# Topic Modeling with LDA

This assignment asks you to do topic modeling via LDA. Follow the example in the code I walked
through in the video. Create a notebook of your own and choose a corpus to analyze. 

You can use corpora based on Twitter data from the data set shares, NY Times articles, 
the convention transcripts, or any other source you like. Ideally you'd have at least 
3-4 groups represented. You don't need to limit your number of topics to the number
of groups you have. 

Once you've chosen your corpus, do the following: 
1. Prepare the data for the `gensim` LDA modeling as in the example. 
1. Fit your model. Feel free to play around with the number of topics and 
the number of passes (and alpha, if you're feeling adventerous.) 
1. Estimate the most likely topic for your documents (or a subset of your
documents). 
1. The topic estimates come with probabilities. For each topic, show the 
single document that had the highest probability of being in that topic.
