Speaker 1: ( 00:33 ) I’m here by calling the full session of the 48th Quadrennial National Convention of the Democratic Party to order. Welcome all to our final session of this historic and memorable convention. We’ve called the 48th Quadrennial Democratic National Convention to order.  Speaker 2: ( 00:59 ) Every four years, we come together to reaffirm our democracy. This year, we’ve come to save it.  Kerry Washington: ( 01:07 ) We fight for a more perfect union because we are fighting for the soul of this country and for our lives. And right now that fight is real.  Bernie Sanders: ( 01:18 ) We must come together to defeat Donald Trump, and elect Joe Biden and Kamala Harris as our next President and Vice President.  Michelle Obama: ( 01:27 ) Donald Trump is the wrong President for our country. He has had more than enough time to prove that he can do the job, but he is clearly in over his head. He simply cannot be who we need him to be for us. It is what it is.  Speaker 3: ( 01:45 ) My dad was a healthy 65 year old. His only preexisting condition was to trusting Donald Trump, and for that, he paid with his life.  Speaker 4: ( 01:55 ) So it’s up to us to carry on the fight for justice. Our actions would be their legacies.  Speaker 5: ( 02:01 ) We just need leadership to bring us back together, to recover from this pandemic and prepare for whatever else is next. Leadership to reimagine what our nation will be. That’s Joe.  Speaker 6: ( 02:19 ) Next President right here.  Speaker 7: ( 02:21 ) He was there for me, he’ll be there for you too.  Speaker 8: ( 02:25 ) Faced with a president of cowardice, Joe Biden is a man of proven courage.  Tracee Ellis Ross: ( 02:31 ) This year, for the first time, the roll call is heading out to all 57 States and territories.  Speaker 1: ( 02:37 ) I’m pleased to announce that Vice President Joe Biden has officially been nominated by the Democratic Party as our candidate for President of the United States.  Joe Biden: ( 02:49 ) I’ll see you on Thursday.  Nancy Pelosi: ( 02:53 ) Our mission is to fight for a future equal to the ideals of our founders, our hopes for our children and sacrifices of our veterans, our brave men and women in uniform and their families.  Speaker 9: ( 03:04 ) The American people are forever indebted to you for all of the work you do on the front line.  Hilary Clinton: ( 03:11 ) We need leaders equal to this moment of sacrifice and service. We need Joe Biden and Kamala Harris.  Barack Obama: ( 03:20 ) Tonight, I’m asking you to believe in Joe and Kamala’s ability to lead this country out of these dark times and build it back back better.  Kamala Harris: ( 03:30 ) In this election, we have a chance to change the course of history. We’re all in this fight together. What an awesome responsibility. What an awesome privilege. I accept your nomination for Vice President of the United States of America.  Tom Perez: ( 04:01 ) Hi, I’m Tom Perez. This has been an incredible week. It hasn’t been the kind of convention you might’ve been expecting, and to be honest, it wasn’t the kind of convention we had planned for, but in a way, what we’ve seen over the last three nights, and what we’ll see tonight is a more accurate reflection of where our country is than any traditional convention could have been. Yes, we’ve talked a lot about our next President and Vice President, Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. We’ve talked about how they’ll tackle the challenges we face and lead our country to a brighter future. And we’ve seen that our party is ready to lead, not just now, but into the next generation. But we’ve also heard a lot from people who aren’t running for anything this year, people who might not even think of themselves as political, auto workers and college students, farmers, and immigrants, teachers, nurses, and yes, the occasional calamari chef.  Tom Perez: ( 04:58 ) If the literal meaning of the word convention has to do with coming together, then what is brought us together this year isn’t partisanship, it’s purpose. That’s what has allowed us to bring both diehard progressive’s and conservative ex Republicans under the same tent. That’s what has allowed us to build a campaign where no State, no precinct, no vote is taken for granted. That’s how we build our movement. That’s how we went up and down the ballot. That’s how we make change. And when we can bring that kind of energy to the challenges, our nation faces, well, there’s nothing we can’t accomplish. Just ask Joe Biden, who set his sights on a mission that could change the world forever conquering cancer.  John F. Kennedy: ( 05:53 ) We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other, not because they are easy, but because they are hard.  Barack Obama: ( 06:00 ) Vice president Biden said that with the new Moonshot America can cure cancer. I’m putting Joe in charge of mission control.  Speaker 10: ( 06:12 ) Beau Biden, the son of Vice President, Joe Biden, succumb to brain cancer, Saturday, at the age of 46.  Joe Biden: ( 06:18 ) He’s the one who wanted me to stay engaged. He was worried that I’d not continue to fight for the things I’m passionate about, and I’m trying to keep his promise.  Speaker 11: ( 06:26 ) President Obama signed to the 21st Century Cures Act, including the so-called Moonshot, that could be a giant leap in the fight to cure cancer.  Speaker 12: ( 06:34 ) The Moonshot is the symbol of American ambition and achievement. Now Vice President Joe Biden will lead a similar effort to cure cancer.  Speaker 13: ( 06:42 ) It will be led by Joe Biden, and it’s aimed at ending the disease that killed the Vice President’s son and 600,000 other Americans every year.  Joe Biden: ( 06:51 ) I think of all the people who have gone through what I’ve gone through without one tenth of the help that I’ve had. When you have a son or daughter, husband or wife, someone you adore, you become as educated as you can, as quickly as you can, particularly when you know that’s a very serious form. I learned a lot about the mechanics of cancer and the delivery systems, and there’s so many changes that are just on the cusp. I have now met with over 200 oncologists and cancer research centers, and I’m asking them, ” What is it you want me to clear the way for? Where are we in impediment?”  Speaker 14: ( 07:24 ) He is determined. He’s not going to walk away until there is real change.  Joe Biden: ( 07:34 ) This is a truly bipartisan issue. So the leaders in this effort in the house and Senate are Republicans as well as Democrats.  Speaker 15: ( 07:42 ) He’s been pushed to the edge of what anyone could be expected to bear.  Speaker 16: ( 07:47 ) Following correction, Joe Biden, Cancer Moonshot.  Speaker 17: ( 07:50 ) You’re a man of substance. You have experienced tragedies in your life, and we are inspired by the way that you have responded to those.  Joe Biden: ( 08:01 ) Every single family in America has been affected by cancer. And we are so close.  Barack Obama: ( 08:07 ) For the loved ones we’ve all lost, let’s make America the country that cures cancer once and for all.  Joe Biden: ( 08:14 ) I believe in Moonshot in this country to cure cancer. It’s personal, but I know we can do this. There are so many breakthroughs just on the horizon. We can make real with an absolute national commitment. There are Democrats and Republicans on the Hill who share our passion to silence this deadly disease. If I could be anything, I would want to be the President of ended cancer, because it’s possible.  Amanda Litman: ( 08:51 ) I’m Amanda Littman. I’m the Co-Founder and Executive Director of Run For Something. In May, 2017, I was invited to join a small meeting in D.C. with a handful of other organization leaders to give updates to the VP on our work. The VP came over, and I tried to play a cool, “Well, my Grammy would be furious if she knew I was at a meeting with you and didn’t get a photo.” “Grammy?” The VP said, perking up as we pose for the photo, you can see here. “Let’s call her.” I called her. “Someone wants to talk to you.” “Hi Grammy, this is Joe Biden.” She was overwhelmed. Grammy went on to tell him her second eldest, my aunt Michelle was in the hospital, colon cancer, advanced, that she was really sick. The VP’s posture changed immediately. “I’m so sorry, Grammy. I’m so, so sorry. You know, my son Beau died of cancer. As a parent, you should never have to even think of one day burying a child. It’s a nightmare.”  Amanda Litman: ( 09:45 ) He stepped away speaking personally with her about sitting in a hospital room with a sick child, about pain. I could hear her choking up on the phone. “I’m giving Amanda my personal home phone number. You need anything, you call me. I’ll come to the hospital and sit with you. Anything.” Grammy still talks about that call. “He’s a genuinely nice man,” she says. “He just gets it.” Her grief, and my family’s grief mattered to him. Our entire country is grieving. We are all going through trauma. Our next president needs to be the one helping us heal. That’s why I’m glad and excited to vote this fall, not just against Trump, but genuinely for Joe Biden.  Tom Perez: ( 10:25 ) Before we continue with tonight’s program, I want to thank everyone who has made this unprecedented convention possible from our delegates and speakers to our party staff and our production team. Next week, it will be the Republican Party’s turn to hold their convention. On behalf of their speakers and staff, I hope their organizers will take safety as seriously as we have. And then it will be up to you, America, you’ll have heard from two very different candidates for President. You’ll be able to dig into the details of their respective plans for solving the challenges we face, and decide which plan you think will work for you and your family.  Tom Perez: ( 11:08 ) But the choice this year is deeper than that. No matter what you think about Donald Trump or Joe Biden, no matter which party you belong to, or whether you belong to any party at all, your job in this election is to decide what kind of movement is capable of being the vehicle for the change we need. Can a movement that demands absolute loyalty to one man and his personal agenda really ever make this country greater? Or do we do better when we join together in a movement of shared values, one that amplifies our diverse voices. We’ve got one more night to show America what our path forward looks like. Not one man, boasting that he alone can fix it, but every day people coming together to face our challenges with unity and determination. Now we turn to one example, California’s fight against the dangerous wildfires raging throughout the State. Please welcome Governor Gavin Newsom.  Governor Gavin Newsom: ( 12:11 ) Well, I confess this is not where I expected to be speaking here tonight. I’m about a mile or so away from one of over 370 wildfires that we’re battling here in the State of California. We are just coming off a record week, a heat wave that led to 130 degree temperatures, the highest temperature ever recorded in California, arguably the world’s history here in our State. The hots are getting hotter, the dries are getting drier. Climate change is real. If you are in denial about climate change, come to California. 11,000 dry lightening strikes, we had over a 72 hour period, leading to this unprecedented challenge with these wildfires.  Governor Gavin Newsom: ( 12:51 ) This is an extraordinary moment in our history. Mother nature has now joined this conversation around climate change. And so we too need to advance that conversation a new. Just today, the President of United States threatened the State of California, 40 million Americans, that happen to live here in the State of California to defund our efforts on wildfire suppression, because he said we hadn’t raked enough leaves. He can’t make that up, nor can he make up the fact we’re involved in over 90 lawsuits with the Trump administration on clean air, on clean water, on endangered species, on pesticides. There is so much at stake in this election, none more important than the work Joe Biden did with Barack Obama on the vehicle emissions standards, the fuel efficiency standards. It will save billions and billions of dollars taxpayers, and reduce our greenhouse gas emissions. There is so much at stake in this election.  Governor Gavin Newsom: ( 13:47 ) I couldn’t help myself on my way to one of our relief centers, one of our evacuation centers, just to jump out of the car and just express my deep reverence, my admiration to Joe Biden, to Kamala Harris, California’s own, to their faith, their devotion, their constancy, to their commitment, and not just to the environment, but to the Commonwealth, to our kids, our kids’ kids, our grandkids, to our legacy. There is so much at stake in this election. And I just want to close by reminding each and every one of you. The future is not just something to experience, it’s something to manifest. It’s inside of us, not just in front of us. It’s our decision, not our conditions that will determine our fate and future. So let us resolve that after this historic night, this incredible, incredible week, this remarkable convention, that we do everything in our power to get Joe Biden and Kamala Harris in to the White House in January, 2021.  Joe Biden: ( 15:06 ) America’s an idea, an idea stronger than any army, bigger than any ocean, more powerful dictator or tyrant. It gives hope. In this nation, we believe in honesty, decency, treating everyone with respect, giving anyone a fair shot, living nobody behind, giving hate no safe harbor, leading by the power of our example, not by the example of our power, that’s allowed us to stand as a beacon to the world, being part of something bigger than ourselves. It’s a code. It’s a uniquely American code, the most powerful idea in the history of the world. The American Creed that we’re all created equal I think beats in the heart of people in this country.  Jon Meachin: ( 16:12 ) This time next year, I hope the virus is in check and the American spirit is unleashed, and that were not fearing but hoping again.  Dolores Huerta: ( 16:22 ) Unity in our country, this is what I hope to see next year.  Senator Daug Jones: ( 16:27 ) I hope we’ve chosen community over chaos, we’ve chosen unity over division, and we’ve chosen love over hate.  Donna Hylton: ( 16:35 ) I believe that America will have faced its darkest moment and will have come out better.  Khizr Khan: ( 16:42 ) America will be coming together, not splintering apart.  Donna Hylton: ( 16:48 ) No more, no more pain.  Ady Barkan: ( 16:51 ) This time next year, I hope that we will have a government that is accountable to us. That guarantees health care as a human right.  Judge Lina Hidalgo: ( 16:58 ) The promise of America will be restored for all our communities, all are families, for all of us. And when I say all of us, [foreign language 00:17:07].  Jim Roosevelt: ( 17:10 ) I am confident that this time next year we will have a President who provides this country with real leadership, not just tweets.  Susan Molinari: ( 17:19 ) This time next year, I hope we are listening less to the Russians and more to Dr. Fauci.  Daniel Dae Kim: ( 17:24 ) I hope we all get back to work.  Senator Yvanna Cancela: ( 17:26 ) There’ll be true Americans why we’ll be happy to say are unemployed, Mitch McConnell and Donald Trump.  Senator Amy Klobuchar: ( 17:33 ) This time next year, I hope that all Americans, whether they are Democrats or Independents or Republicans, will be proud of their President, will be proud of their Vice President.  Andrew Yang: ( 17:45 ) And that our recovery is truly people up, families up, and communities up.  Senator Elizabet Warren: ( 17:49 ) That people believe they have a government that is working for them. That’s out there every day everyday doing its best for them.  Danica Roem: ( 17:58 ) I want to see a President of the United States, who can look at a trans-woman in the eye and tell her her rights are worth protecting.  Robyn Senior: ( 18:04 ) I hope America has a president that champions the rights of all young women and girls.  Miyoko Hikiji: ( 18:09 ) This time next year, I want a President who understands what military families need.  Vilissa Thompson: ( 18:14 ) Who cares about the rights and lives of fellow people.  Mari Manoogian: ( 18:18 ) Who will care about our environment again.  Mayor Robert Garcia: ( 18:20 ) Will pass comprehensive immigration reform.  LT. Peggy Flanagan: ( 18:23 ) I hope we have a president who honors treaty rights and tribal sovereignty.  Luz Chaparro Hernandez: ( 18:27 ) A year from now, I hope to see the kids playing on the playground.  Brittney Hubert: ( 18:31 ) I take pride in my job in helping our customers, but next year, I want to do it without wearing a mask or gloves.  Beto O’rourke: ( 18:40 ) I hope that we were all celebrating landmark legislation that the Biden Harris administration have shepherded through Congress and signed into law.  Fred Guttenberg: ( 18:49 ) This time next year, parents will again be able to look forward to the day where we can send our children to school without fear of gun violence.  Khizr Khan: ( 19:00 ) This time.  Judge Lina Hidalgo: ( 19:01 ) This time next year.  Mayor Robert Garcia: ( 19:01 ) This time next year.  Mari Manoogian: ( 19:01 ) This time next year.  Rep. Marcia Fudge: ( 19:02 ) I hope that this country realizes that we have in fact, reclaim the soul of America.  Colin Powell: ( 19:07 ) This time next year, I hope and pray that America will have restored democracy.  Jaime Harrison: ( 19:13 ) We recommit ourselves to come together, one nation under God.  Major General Frank Vavala: ( 19:18 ) One nation under God, indivisible with liberty and justice for all.  Kamala Harris: ( 19:25 ) This time next year, I want to see Joe Biden in the oval office.  Andrew Yang: ( 19:28 ) Hello America, I’m Andrew Yang. You might know me as the guy who ran for President talking about math in the future. Unfortunately for all of us, that future is now. The pandemic has accelerated everything. If you’re like me and my wife, Evelyn, you don’t know if your child’s school is going to reopen this fall. 72% of Americans believe that this is the worst time we have ever experienced. And 42% of the jobs that have been lost, millions of jobs will never return. We are in a deep dark hole, and we need leaders who will help us dig out. I know many politicians promise and then fail to deliver. If you voted for Trump or didn’t vote it all back in 2016, I get it.  Andrew Yang: ( 20:20 ) Many of us have gotten tired of our leaders, seeming far removed from our everyday lives, and we despair that our government will ever rise to the challenges of our time. But we must give this country, our country, a chance to recover. And recovery is only possible with a change of leadership and new ideas. Bold and innovative policies that will get help into your hands in the midst of this crisis are now possible, but we need your help to turn the page for our country in 75 days. We are here tonight to celebrate Joe Biden’s nomination as the Democratic candidate for President. I have gotten to know both Joe and Kamala on the trail over the past year. The way you really get to know a person, when the cameras are off, the crowds are gone. It’s just you in them. They’re real people. They understand the problems we face. There are parents and patriots who want the best for us and our country. And if we give them the chance, they will fight for us and our families every single day.  Andrew Yang: ( 21:14 ) Our future is now, and it is daunting. But I ask you tonight to join me, to help Joe and Kamala fight for the promise of America, turn the page for our country and lead us forward to a future we’ll actually be proud to leave to our children. And now I’d like to turn it over to a great Democrat who will be with us throughout the evening. Between the two of us, we have 11 Emmys. How’s that for math? One of my favorite actresses, Julia Louis Dreyfus. Hey Julia.  Julia Louis-Dreyfus: ( 21:39 ) Hi Andrew. It’s so glad to see you. So what did you think about Kamala Harris’s speech last night?  Andrew Yang: ( 21:46 ) It was tremendous. I was so happy for her.  Julia Louis-Dreyfus: ( 21:48 ) I know me too. She was fabulous. I cannot wait to see her debate. Our current Vice President Mika Pints, or is it Paints?  Andrew Yang: ( 21:58 ) It’s pronounced Pants, I believe.  Julia Louis-Dreyfus: ( 22:01 ) Oh, some kind of weird foreign name?  Andrew Yang: ( 22:04 ) Yeah, not very American sounding.  Julia Louis-Dreyfus: ( 22:06 ) Yeah, that’s what people are saying, strongly. Well, thank you, Andrew. And please give my regards to the gang.  Andrew Yang: ( 22:15 ) I will. They’re right in the next room. Have a great night, Julia.  Julia Louis-Dreyfus: ( 22:18 ) Thank you so much. Good evening America, and welcome to the fourth night of the 2020 Democratic National Convention, Uniting America. Okay, these last few nights have been going so well, we decided to add a fifth night where we will just play Michelle Obama’s speech on a loop. I first met Joe Biden when I was doing my show Veep. I played the Vice President and he was in fact, the Vice President, and we hit it off immediately. Soon after I was asked to be on the cover of a magazine. Remember those? And I was so excited. It was like, “Oh, what’s it going to be People or Vogue or Rolling Stone?” Well, it turns out it was for Arrive, the official onboard magazine of Amtrak, which nobody ever reads, even though it’s free.  Julia Louis-Dreyfus: ( 23:14 ) The day it came out, my phone rang and it was the Vice President telling me he loves the cover and the whole article, and that it was one of the best issues of Arrive he had ever read. And that is just one of the many reasons that I wanted to be here tonight for Joe, and to remind you that Joe Biden not only knows how to read, but also he reads everything. I am no policy expert and I certainly don’t pretend to be one, but I have a gut feeling about fairness and what’s right, and that is why I am so excited that just in a little while, we’re going to hear from Joe Biden about his plans for America. Plans for a strong economy that helps working people and small businesses, not just billionaires, and plans to raise the wages for the nurses and teachers and grocery workers that are getting us through this crisis. God, love them.  Julia Louis-Dreyfus: ( 24:12 ) So how can you help Joe? It’s super simple vote. Right now, you can text, Vote, to 30330 to learn about all of your voting options and make the best plan for how to vote in your community, wherever you are. An easy way to remember 30330, is that’s the year Donald Trump will finally release his tax returns. If we all vote, there is nothing Facebook, Fox News and Vladimir Putin can do to stop us. But first let’s reaffirm the all American values that our party and Joe Biden stand for.  Speaker 18: ( 24:50 ) [inaudible 00:00:24:54].  Speaker 19: ( 24:58 ) [inaudible 00:24: 55], do it while you’re smiling. Okay?  Speaker 18: ( 25:00 ) Ready? And action.  Speaker 20: ( 25:01 ) I pledge the allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for which is stands, one nation under God, indivisible, for Liberty and Justice for all.  Speaker 18: ( 25:17 ) Awesome.  Sister Simone Campbell: ( 27:02 ) Good evening. I’m Sister Simone Campbell, Executive Director of Network, and leader of Nuns On The Bus. Tonight marks an important next chapter in our story of who we will become as a nation. So I speak to you with a sense of urgency and hope, knowing the difficult work ahead, but grounded in my faith. The very first paragraph of the scripture that informs the three Abrahamic traditions tells us the divine spirit breezed over the waters of chaos and brought forth a new creation. Encouraged by this promise that a new creation can come from chaos, let us pray.  Sister Simone Campbell: ( 27:42 ) Oh, Divine Spirit, during the weeks and months ahead, stir our hearts and minds that we might fight for a vision that is worthy of you and you’re called to honor the dignity of all of your creation. A vision of who we are as a people grounded in community and care for all, especially the most marginalized. A vision that cares for our earth and heals the planet. A vision that ends structural racism, bigotry, and sexism so rife now in our nation and in our history. A vision that ensures hungry people are fed, children are nourished, immigrants are welcomed. Oh, spirit breathe in us and our leaders a new resolve that committed to this new American promise, we will work together to build a national community grounded in healing, fearlessly based on truth, and living out of a sense of shared responsibility. In the name of all that is holy, Oh Spirit, bring out of this time of global and national chaos, a new creation, a new community that can with your help realize this new promise that we affirmed tonight. And so with profound hope, let we, the people say, Amen.  Senator Chris Coons: ( 29:15 ) Thank you, Sister Simone. People of faith have long led change from abolition and women’s suffrage, to the labor movement and the struggle for civil rights. Joe Biden will continue that progressive March towards justice, inspired by respect for the dignity of all people, people Joe believes were made in the image of God. Joe learned that from his parents and the nuns and priests right here in Delaware, who taught him and inspired in him a passion for justice. I’m Senator Chris Coons of Delaware, and I want to tell you about my friend, Joe Biden. His faith is strong and it’s personal and private.  Senator Chris Coons: ( 29:49 ) For Joe faith isn’t a prop or a political tool. I’ve known Joe about 30 years, and I’ve seen his faith in action. Joe knows the power of prayer, and I’ve seen him in moments of joy and triumph, of loss and spare turn to God for strength. Joe’s comforted me in my toughest moments, as he has so many others. I’ll never forget how Joe took the time to offer me words of comfort as my father lay in hospice. Time and again, I’ve seen him stop everything and listen, really, listen to someone who needs a shoulder to cry on or partner in prayer. That compassion, that empathy is part of his character.  Senator Chris Coons: ( 30:27 ) More than anything chose a man of faith and conscience, he’ll be a precedent for Americans of all face as well as people of conscience who practice no particular faith. Joe’s faith is really about our future, about a world with less suffering and more justice, where we’re better stewards of creation, where we have a more just immigration policy, and where we call out and confront the original sins of this nation, the sins of slavery and racism. Joe knows these are central issues in this election, and for him, they’re rooted in faith.  Senator Chris Coons: ( 30:58 ) Joe knows that it’s faith that sustained so many ordinary Americans who do extraordinary things. Nurses who brave infection, firefighters who run into burning buildings, teachers working overtime, especially now, they all deserve a servant leader who knows the dignity of work, who sees them, respects them, fights for them. We need a President who brings people of all faiths together to tackle our challenges, rebuild our country and restore our humanity. Someone who knows we’re called to do justice, love mercy, and walk humbly with our God. Joe Biden will be that President. Joe has always known this race is a battle for the soul of our country, and he’s right. Joe believes, he believes in both the greatness and the goodness of this country. He believes in us, and in what we can do together, my question  Rev. Anthony Thompson: ( 31:50 ) My question is what is your faith, and how would you use your faith in make decisions for our nation?  Joe Biden: ( 31:59 ) Reverend, I kind of know what it’s like to lose family, and my heart goes out to you. But you may remember, after Barack and Michelle and I were there, and my family, I came back on that Sunday to regular service, because I had just lost my son, and I wanted some hope because what you all did was astounding. I don’t know if you all know this, all those who died, were killed by this white supremacist, they forgave him, the ultimate act of Christian charity. They forgave him. Reverend I’m not proselytizing, I happened to be a practicing Catholic, but I went back to the church because I found, particularly, the black church, and this case was me and me, it was not an Episcopal church. I found.  Joe Biden: ( 33:03 ) Not Episcopal Church, I found that there’s that famous phrase from Kierkegaard, faith sees best in the dark. I find the one thing it gives me, and I’m not trying to process. I’m not trying to convince you to share my religious views. But for me, it’s important because it gives me some reason to have hope and purpose.  Julia Louis-Dreyfus: ( 33:32 ) Just remember, Joe Biden goes to church so regularly that he doesn’t even need tear gas and a bunch of federalized troops to help him get there. No one fought harder for your right to vote than John Lewis. Here to speak about him and his legacy, we have one of our great mayors, Atlanta’s Keisha Lance Bottoms. Mayor Bottoms, hello. I know that you’re recovering from the Corona virus. How are you feeling?  Keisha Lance Bottoms: ( 34:03 ) Well, good evening. I feel really good. Thank you for asking. My husband on the other hand is still having many of the lingering side effects that people talk about, but all in all our family’s doing great.  Julia Louis-Dreyfus: ( 34:15 ) Well, I’m glad to hear it, but boy, I think a lot of Americans are going to be dealing with that for a long time. Hey Mayor, I wanted to ask you something. Is Atlanta ready for election day?  Keisha Lance Bottoms: ( 34:31 ) We will be ready and we are going to do everything that we can to make sure that voting goes smoothly. But we are encouraging people if you can vote early in your state, to please do so. Early vote during the early vote.  Julia Louis-Dreyfus: ( 34:47 ) Perfect. Excellent advice. Over 40 States now allow some form of early voting. Okay. Stay safe mayor and I turn it over to you.  Keisha Lance Bottoms: ( 35:00 ) Well, thank you, Julia and good evening. I’m Keisha Lance Bottoms, a mother of four and mayor of Atlanta, Georgia, cradle of the civil rights movement and like so many other cities, a place where the struggle for human dignity continues. I’m proud to have grown up in this city, educated in its public schools and blessed to have known our hometown heroes like Dr. Joseph Lowery, Dr. C.T. Vivian and our teacher, our friend, our conscience, our Congressman John Lewis. He walked gently amongst us, not as a distant icon but as a God fearing man who did what he could to fulfill the as yet unfulfilled promise of America.  Keisha Lance Bottoms: ( 35:54 ) People often think that they can’t make a difference like our civil rights icons, but every person in the movement mattered. Those who made the sandwiches, swept the church floors, stuffed the envelopes, they too change America and so can we. The baton has now been passed to each of us. We’ve cried out for justice, we have gathered in our streets to demand change and now we must pass on the gift john Lewis sacrifice to give us. We must register and we must vote. In his parting essay written to us, congressman Lewis expressed his pride in the activism that has swept our country and he reminded us that if we fail to exercise our right to vote, we can lose it.  Keisha Lance Bottoms: ( 36:56 ) There are those who are disgracefully using this pandemic to spread misinformation and interfere with voting, forcing many in 2020 to still risk their lives to exercise their sacred right to vote. A right that has already been paid for with the blood, sweat, tears, and lives of so many. So let’s stand up for our children, our children’s children and for this great democracy that our ancestors worked to build and let’s vote. Let’s organize to get others to vote with us. You can help make this happen by texting vote to 30330.  Keisha Lance Bottoms: ( 37:48 ) We know how important it is that we elect real leaders like Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, people of honor and integrity, who hold justice close to their hearts and believe that the lives of my four black children matter. In the words of womanist poet, Audre Lorde, your silence will not protect you. Congressman Lewis would not be silenced and neither can we. We cannot wait for some other time, some other place, some other heroes. We must be the heroes of our generation because we too are America. Our votes can be our voice.  Speaker 21: ( 38:51 ) There’s something deep down within me moving me that I could no longer be satisfied or go along with an evil system.  Andrew Young: ( 39:05 ) Life was extremely dangerous when we were growing up. John Lewis had the respect of everybody because he was the one who demonstrated the most courage. He’d been beaten and knocked down and get up and go to fight another battle. John was focused on ending voter suppression and it wasn’t that he was a great orator, is that he was a great spirit. The power of spirituality and humility and the willingness to suffer rather than to inflict suffering.  Elijah Cummings: ( 39:56 ) One of the things that John has taught us is that, you may have to sacrifice but if you’re sacrificing for a cause, something bigger than you, bigger than you and you really believe in it, then you will have people following you.  John Lewis: ( 40:12 ) If we do not get meaningful legislation out of this Congress, we will march through the South, through the streets of Jackson, through the streets of Danville, through the streets of Cambridge, through the streets of Birmingham.  James M. Lawson Jr.: ( 40:34 ) I think he is the singular figure that has tried to carry out the work of our nonviolent campaigns into the halls of Congress.  Nancy Pelosi: ( 40:43 ) From day one, John Lewis was a role model for the members of Congress, whether they were freshmen are here a long time because he brought with him a kind of heft of weightiness of purpose.  John Lewis: ( 40:58 ) I got arrested a few times during the 60s, 40 times and since I’ve been in Congress, another five times. The means by which we struggle must be consistent with the end we seek.  Stacey Abrams: ( 41:16 ) Someone who has navigated thorny issues of policy not by castigating alone, but by also encouraging people to be better than they think they can be.  John Lewis: ( 41:26 ) Today we are considering a fair housing marriage, which not only protect our nation’s minorities, but it protects the need for those with disabilities and families with children. How long do we have to wait before we decide to ban assault weapons? We have another opportunity to bring more of our citizens into political participation. I have on my marching shoes, I’m fighting. I’m ready to march.  Raphael Warnock: ( 41:53 ) All of these decades later while he and others of his generation achieved much, we’re still fighting against police brutality and fighting for our voting rights. So we best honor him by continuing to fight the good fights that he fought by staying in good trouble.  Raphael Warnock: ( 42:33 ) ( singing).  John Lewis: ( 43:09 ) We will create a beloved community. We will redeem the soul of America. As a nation and as a people we will get there.  John Lewis: ( 43:18 ) (singing).  Julia Louis-Dreyfus: ( 48:06 ) Wow. That was so beautiful. John and Common. Wow. Joe Biden shares John Lewis’ has belief that every vote matters. Personally, I plan to follow the example of six current cabinet members, vice-president Poons and President Trump himself, and vote by mail. To find out everything you need to know about mailing ballots, your polling place or even just am I registered, text vote to 30330. 30330, that would be the president’s golf score if he didn’t cheat. Okay, look, I’ll admit that was a little nasty, but we all know he’s a cheater and I’m proud to be a nasty, nasty woman. When Donald Trump spoke at his inauguration about American carnage, I assumed that was something he was against, not a campaign promise. What we need now is great leadership. Someone experienced in hard working and intelligent. Someone who understands the soul of the American people.  Jon Meacham: ( 49:15 ) I’m historian Jon Meacham. In his final Sunday sermon, days before his death, Martin Luther King Jr said, “We are tied together in the single garment of destiny. This is the way God’s universe is made. This is the way it is structured.” A single garment of destiny. We the people cannot escape that reality nor as Lincoln taught us, can you and I escape history. And we shouldn’t want to for many of us have been given much; liberty, opportunity, a sense of possibility. The task of our time is to make sure those gifts are available not just to folks who look like me but to all of us.  Jon Meacham: ( 50:02 ) This is a grave moment in America. A deadly virus is ravaging us. Our jobs are evaporating. Our faith and the things that bind us together is fraying for our democracy is under assault from an incumbent, more interested in himself than he is in the rest of us. Extremism, nativism, isolationism and a lack of economic opportunity for working people are all preventing us from realizing our nation’s promise. So we must decide whether we will continue to be prisoners of the darkest of American forces or will we free ourselves to write a brighter, better, nobler story? That’s the issue of this election. A choice that goes straight to the nature of the soul of America.  Jon Meacham: ( 50:52 ) Humankind has long viewed the soul as the vital center, the core, the essence of existence. The soul is what makes us us. In its finest hours, America’s soul has been animated by the proposition that we are all created equal and by the imperative to ensure that we are treated equally. Yet, America is a mix of light and shadow. Seneca falls and Selma and Stonewall dwell in the American soul but so do the impulses that have given us slavery, segregation and systemic discrimination.  Jon Meacham: ( 51:28 ) Often we’d prefer to hear the trumpets rather than face the tragedies but an honest accounting of who we’ve been, can enable us to see who we should be. A country driven by the best parts of our soul, not by the worst. A country informed by reason and candor, not by ego and lies. A country that’s big hearted, not narrow minded. The struggle to be who we ought to be is difficult, demanding and ongoing. Justice can be elusive and change in America has been painful and provisional. The civil war led to segregation. The new deal to right wing reaction, civil rights to white backlash, yet history, which will surely be our judge, can also be our guide. From Harriet Tubman to Alice Paul, to John Lewis from the beaches of Normandy, to the rendering of the iron curtain, our story has soared when we’ve built bridges, not walls. When we’ve lent a hand, not when we’ve pointed fingers. When we’ve hoped not feared.  Jon Meacham: ( 52:39 ) If we live in hope, we open our souls to the power of love. We’ve been taught to love our neighbors as ourselves. As individuals and as a nation, however, we fail at following that commandment more often than we succeed. But when we fail, we must try again and again and again, for only in trial is progress possible. From Jamestown forward, our story has become fuller and fairer because of people who share a conviction that Dr. King articulated on that Sunday half a century ago; the arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice. Bending that arc requires all of us. It requires we, the people, and it requires a president of the United States with empathy, grace, a big heart and an open mind. Joe Biden will be such a president. With our voices and our votes, let us now write the next chapter of the American story; one of hope, of love, of justice. If we do so, we might just save our country and our souls.  Deb Haaland: ( 53:58 ) Good evening. I’m Congresswoman Deb Haaland. I’m grateful to be with you here on indigenous land. The promise of this country is older than our constitution. Over 500 years ago, thousands of Indian tribes were vibrant democratic societies with rich cultures and traditions and communities that had sustained them for millennia on lands they loved and respected. My people, the Pueblo Indians, migrated to the Rio Grande Valley in the late 1200s to escape droughts. We were led to the great river and its tributaries, where we established an agricultural tradition that continues to this day. My people survived centuries of slavery, genocide and brutal assimilation policies. But throughout our past, tribal nations have fought for and helped build this country. There were those like my Laguna grandparents who worked on our country’s railroad and those like my mother, a Navy veteran, who served this country with honor. I stand here today, a proud 35th generation new Mexican, and one of the first native American women ever elected to Congress. I’m a symbol of our resilience as the embodiment of America’s progress as a nation.  Deb Haaland: ( 55:21 ) I know we can’t take our democracy for granted, especially now, as people are dying, as our land is abused, as our constitution is under attack. We must work for it by getting involved, by registering voters, by voting. Voting is sacred. Why people know that. We weren’t universally granted the right to vote until 1962 and that fundamental right is more important than ever. Whether your ancestors have been here for hundreds of years or you’re a new citizen, know this, whether we vote and how we vote will determine if our nation’s promise of social, racial and environmental justice will outlast us. Joe Biden and Kamala Harris respect our past and understand our present. They will see us through this crisis of leadership that is plaguing our country, and they will help us to build a better future. Thank you.  Deb Haaland: ( 56:23 ) (singing).  Sara: ( 56:27 ) The first year that I voted was 1974.  Terry: ( 56:30 ) 1967.  James: ( 56:32 ) I have not missed a general or a primary election in my 51 year voting history.  Seymour: ( 56:38 ) Now I don’t go to the polls anymore. The U.S. postal service does it for me.  Terry: ( 56:44 ) And we’re seeing our current president sabotage our right to vote, sabotaging democracy by trying to undo the postal system.  James: ( 56:54 ) My father worked for the postal service for 30 years.  Pat: ( 56:58 ) My mother worked for that local post office for 10 years. That job enabled her to feed her family.  James: ( 57:05 ) I am appalled at what the Republicans and the president are trying to do to subvert the vote.  Jeffrey: ( 57:12 ) Nothing or no one will stop me from voting this election.  Sara: ( 57:16 ) We need to keep our mail system. We need Joe Biden.  Sara: ( 57:19 ) (singing)  Donald Trump: ( 57:21 ) Where are they going? Where are these ballots going? Who’s getting them? Who is not getting them? A little section that’s Republican. Will they be stolen from mailboxes as they get put in by the mailman? Will they be taken from the mailman and the mail women? Will they be forged? Who is signing to them? Who’s shining them? Are they signed at the kitchen table and sent in? Will they be counterfeited by groups inside our nation? Will they be counterfeited maybe by the millions by foreign powers?  Speaker 22: ( 58:09 ) Let me put this in my own words. I’ve heard Donald Trump say some pretty unhinged things. I’ve heard them over and over and over again, but nothing is more dangerous to our democracy than his attacks on mailing voting during a pandemic. Okay? Here’s the truth. Donald Trump doesn’t want any of us to vote because he knows he can’t win fair and square. So whether you plan to vote by mail or in person wearing your mask, it is your vote and it’s your right. Don’t let Donald Trump take that away from you. For accurate up to date voting information that you can trust, text vote to 30330. One more time. Text vote to 30330.  Alex Padilla: ( 58:58 ) I’m Alex Padilla, California Secretary of State.  Jocelyn Benson: ( 59:01 ) And I’m Jocelyn Benson, the Secretary of State of Michigan  Alex Padilla: ( 59:05 ) Voting is the oxygen of our democracy. It decides elections and elections change lives. That’s why we’ve seen so many attacks on our right to vote, including many that specifically target working families, young people and communities of color.  Jocelyn Benson: ( 59:21 ) Secretaries of state are responsible for running fair, accessible, secure elections, where every vote is counted and every voice has heard. We serve on the front lines, defending our democracy against any and all attacks, foreign and domestic.  Alex Padilla: ( 59:37 ) So let’s talk about this election, despite what he says, Donald Trump can’t cancel it, but he and Republicans are making it too hard for so many to cast their ballots. And now he’s attacking a vote by mail to distract and confuse voters.  Jocelyn Benson: ( 59:52 ) And let’s be clear, there is absolutely zero difference between voting by mail and voting absentee. Millions of Americans have been voting absentee for decades. Donald Trump, his family, his staff, they all vote by mail. In fact, in States like Colorado, Utah and Oregon, voters have been voting by mail for years. Republicans and Democrats agree, it is safe.  Alex Padilla: ( 01:00:16 ) But now Trump has admitted he’s trying to sabotage the post office to undermine voting by mail and we’re not going to let them do that. Our job is to make sure everyone can vote safely, whether in person or by mail, and your job is to make sure you vote.  Jocelyn Benson: ( 01:00:34 ) And there’s more. Once you’ve done that, talk to your friends and neighbors, spread the word. Tell everyone you know to text vote to 30330 for more voting options. If you’re planning to vote from home, request and return your ballot early and remind everyone you know to make a plan to vote.  Alex Padilla: ( 01:00:54 ) Don’t let anyone keep you from exercising your most sacred right. Make your plan to vote. Grab your mask and head to the polls the first day they’re open or request your ballot and send it in right away. And know this, election results may take a little longer this year, but Democrats will fight to make sure your ballot is counted.  Jocelyn Benson: ( 01:01:16 ) Because at the end of the day, the biggest role in preserving our democracy isn’t ours, it’s yours.  Jocelyn Benson: ( 01:01:27 ) (singing)  Eva Gutowski: ( 01:01:30 ) Our family has a crazy history with America and it all starts with it being a beacon for immigrants. It’s really cool being like part Polish and part Puerto Rican and also part black because I get to, for me personally, I get to be this like melting pot of America.  Jack G.: ( 01:01:47 ) If you were an immigrant back then, come from an immigrant family, the Democrats brought you in. We’re in danger of losing the meaning of this country.  Eva Gutowski: ( 01:01:57 ) Every generation before us has had to fight for what they believe in and it’s just our turn now.  Jack G.: ( 01:02:03 ) I was proud when I saw the demonstrations that were going on across the country.  Eva Gutowski: ( 01:02:08 ) This year’s election means a lot to me because I feel like our generation is so motivated right now to make a difference. There’s a lot of changes that we have to make and I’m counting on Joe Biden and I believe in him.  Speaker 23: ( 01:02:33 ) I’m here because a union job lifted my family out of poverty and into the middle class. My grandfather left the Jim Crow South for Detroit, joined the UAW and got a job on the assembly lines during world war two. That union job enabled him to support his family, raise my mom and send her to Fisk University. That’s the American dream. Together we work, together we rise. Joe Biden and Kamala Harris know the dignity of all working Americans. They know the urgency and the demand of our dream. But working people are under attack. The wealth gap grows, our middle class shrinks and poverty persists. Last week Donald Trump said, and I quote, “Our economy is doing good,” while 40 million Americans are at risk of losing their homes, 30 million aren’t getting enough to eat and 5.4 million people have lost their healthcare because of this crisis. He has failed us but still I believe in the dream of our ancestors.  Speaker 23: ( 01:03:46 ) Together with Joe and Kamala in the White House will raise the minimum wage so no one who works a full time job in America lives in poverty. Together we’ll fight for those who keep us healthy, who keep us safe, who teach our children. We’ll stand for those who cook and serve and clean, who plant and harvest, who pack and always those who deliver. Whose hands are thick with calluses like my granddad’s were. Who lifted me high, who held mine when I was a boy. If he was alive, Joe and Kamala, he would be so proud of you. And he’d tell us, “Take another by the hand and another, and let’s get to work. This dream ain’t free. You got to work for it.” So like his generation up and out of the depression, let’s now work together and stand together. And America, together we will rise.  Joe Biden: ( 01:04:57 ) There is my team. You guys build America, not Wall Street. You build America, right?  Gerald Lang: ( 01:05:03 ) Americans just want to live meekly comfortable. I’ve got a wife that works as well. I’ve got a 17 and a seven year old at home, and we’re still working. Thanks to our international executive board for getting with general motors and making sure that it’s safe for us to return back to work after eight weeks of being laid off. I mean, it’s a hoax at one point and now here we are a full blown.  Joe Biden: ( 01:05:25 ) Yep. Well, I tell you what the future of auto workers America, and I really believe this, can be as bright as it was back in the late 40s and 50s.  Gerald Lang: ( 01:05:38 ) Yes.  Joe Biden: ( 01:05:38 ) Simple reason, it’s an iconic industry. It’s an American industry. We made it. We made it.  Gerald Lang: ( 01:05:44 ) Yes. Thank you.  Robert Lopez: ( 01:05:46 ) It’s been a very interesting point 2020. I’ve been in the fire service 16 years and never experienced anything like COVID. We got to change our whole tactics, the way we did our day to day and now had a hurricane that just came in two weeks ago and we were almost right on the-  Robert Lopez: ( 01:06:03 ) … That just came in two weeks ago, and we were almost right on the eye. I mean, we were doing things we never thought we’d be doing, water rescues with masks on, having to worry about COVID. It was interesting.  Joe Biden: ( 01:06:15 ) How is your family going?  Robert Lopez: ( 01:06:17 ) Well, I’m a single dad. I have a almost five-year-old, who is my world. And I’m very lucky that my parents are retired. My mom actually retired right after my daughter was born to help us with her. She was so looking forward to pre-K, going to the preschool, and then unfortunately all this COVID came in and now it’s all going to be online schooling, which I’m fortunate. I have my parents, but I do have a lot of guys that are double income families, and they’re just trying to figure out how they’re going to do it with their kids. What arrangements are they going to have to make since they’re not going to be going to school, it’s going to be online.  Natasha Taylor: ( 01:06:53 ) It’s two people in my household. I have a family of two, and we have grown-up kids that are no longer in the household. But it takes two people to build. We have an ongoing goal of a five year goal of buying a house in the next five years. So hopefully we’ll save, save, save.  Joe Biden: ( 01:07:12 ) Look, everybody, you talk about the middle class. The fact is that the way middle class generate wealth, overwhelmingly is building up equity in their home. It naturally gets passed on from one generation to the next, the equity in the home.  Rob Bair: ( 01:07:28 ) The middle class is continuously taking hits. And one of the reasons why we’re on this call is we realize how important it is to have you in the White House. We need a comprehensive energy policy for renewable resources, which I know you have one. And if we’re going to build the middle class, it’s about the jobs.  Joe Biden: ( 01:07:49 ) The future really rests on investment. We’re going to be investing $2 trillion in infrastructure. Ports, bridges, highways, making sure that we have access to do things that really make a difference. Like what you’re doing, that solar facility outside of Harrisburg. I’m a Scranton boy, central Pennsylvania is okay, but Northeast, keep the faith guys.  Rob Bair: ( 01:08:14 ) Thank you sir.  Natasha Taylor: ( 01:08:16 ) Thank you so much, we appreciate you.  Vivek Murthy: ( 01:08:22 ) I know it’s not typical for a former surgeon general to speak at a convention. Surgeons general are appointed by presidents, but our work isn’t about politics. Our highest duty is to the public. Our true guide is science, and our job is to speak the truth about public health, even when it’s controversial or perceived as political. So here’s the truth. Our nation absolutely has what it takes to overcome the COVID-19 pandemic that’s claimed tens of thousands of our loved ones. We have the talent, resources and technology. What we’re missing is leadership. We need a leader who works with States to ensure that everyone who needs a test gets one, and gets results quickly. A leader who secures a safe, effective vaccine, and distributes it quickly and fairly. A leader who inspires us to practice distancing, and wear masks, not as a political statement, but as a patriotic duty, a commitment we make to one another.  Vivek Murthy: ( 01:09:26 ) That’s why I’m here tonight. Not because of politics or for party, but because I know Joe Biden can be that leader. I’ve worked with Joe Biden. I’ve seen who he is with no cameras around, how he sits with people in their pain, and holds them in his heart. How he pours over COVID briefings, asking smart questions, letting science guide his way, just as he did when managing the Ebola crisis. And six years ago, when Joe Biden met my family, many of them immigrants, awed to be in the nation’s Capitol, I saw how he kneeled beside my grandmother’s wheelchair, took her hands in his, and said, “Thank you for choosing us, the United States of America as the place to trust with your family.” Tonight, as a father, son, and grandson, as the doctor who swore an oath, and as an American who loves my country, I can tell you that Joe Biden is the man I trust to look out for my family, and the leader I know will heal this nation.  Tammy Baldwin: ( 01:10:39 ) Hi, I’m Senator Tammy Baldwin. When I was nine years old, I got sick, really sick. I was hospitalized, but since my grandparents were the ones raising me, and our family’s health plan didn’t cover grandkids, they were forced to pay out of pocket for my three month hospital stay. I got better, but the insurance companies didn’t. They refused to cover me at any cost because I was marked child with a preexisting condition. We all have stories like this, stories about a time when the system was rigged against us. When we were counted out, left out, pushed out. Just think of what we’ve heard these past four days, healthcare professionals who don’t have the protective gear they need, young people whose asthma will get worse as our air quality does, workers who are afraid of losing their jobs. Each story begs this simple fundamental question, a question that gets to the heart of the choice in this election.  Tammy Baldwin: ( 01:11:46 ) What kind of country do we want to be? Do we want to be a country where millionaires get to dodge taxes? Or one where working families get a break? Do we want to be a country where medical bills bury people in debt, or one where healthcare is affordable for all? Or where tens of thousands of people die from a virus, or where the American dream lives? I think we know the answer to that fundamental question, because most of us want the same things. Good schools in our neighborhoods, racial justice, the freedom to love who we want, dignity in our work, and an economy where small businesses and working families thrive. And over the past months, we’ve added another to that list. A nation free from COVID. That’s why Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are the only answer in this election. Trust me. They are.  Tammy Baldwin: ( 01:12:53 ) You see, there’s another part of my story, the part where I ran for office, the part where I served in Congress, the part where I worked with Joe Biden and Barack Obama to make sure kids, and grandkids, if they’re dependents can stay on their parents’ health insurance until they’re 26. We got that done. And yes, it was a big effing deal. That’s the America I know, that’s the America I love, and that’s the America we will be with Joe Biden and Kamala Harris in the White House. A nation that plans, a nation that builds, a nation that builds back. Say it with me there at home, a nation that builds back better. Here in Wisconsin, our state motto is just one word, forward. This November, let’s move forward and never look back. Thank you.  Joe Biden: ( 01:13:51 ) No other nation. No other nation can match us if we step up, if we lead by the power of our example, not by the example of our power. The only thing that could tear America apart is America itself, and we can not let that happen.  Julia Louis-Dreyfus: ( 01:14:15 ) If you want to help Joe and Kamala make sure that America stays strong and united, please go to JoeBiden.com and contribute anything that you possibly can. Tonight, I couldn’t be prouder to be a loyal union member, a passionate climate activist, and a patriotic Democrat, or as Donald Trump will call me in a Tweet tomorrow, a washed up horse face no talent has been with low ratings. Well, with all due respect sir, it takes one to know one. And now I’d like to introduce you to a real American hero, World War II veteran Ed Good.  Edward Good: ( 01:14:55 ) I am Edward Good. I’m 95 years old. I’m a veteran of World War II, and of Korea. When I wear a uniform, I wear only two badges. My parachute wings, and the combat infantry badge. I did make one combat jump over the Rhine in Germany. And I’m proud of that. I have been a Republican since the 1960s. I’m a member of the NRA, and I voted for Trump. I think Trump has been the worst president we’ve ever had. So I’ll be glad to see him go. I think Joe Biden will be a great leader for the United States. Like me, on the day of my jump into Germany, I think Joe Biden cares about doing his proper duty for the United States. And if he’s elected, that’s what he will do.  Michael: ( 01:16:01 ) This year’s election is very important. Probably be the most important election we’ve had in years. I recommend strongly based on the division in this country created by our current president, Donald Trump, we need to put somebody else in the White House that’s going to bring us together. Now, let me just explain something. I’ve been a longstanding Republican for a long time, and I’m telling you, you got to vote for Joe Biden. You have to. I don’t think we can deal with the type of person we have in the White House any longer. So it’s up to you, America, and me, because in this election, I’m voting for Joe. I’m sure, I’m absolutely sure he’s going to help us bring this country together once again.  Lakeisha Cole: ( 01:16:55 ) My name is Lakeisha Cole. I met my husband 20 years ago. When we started dating while I was in college, once I graduated from college, we eloped. Two weeks after that he deployed.  Speaker 24: ( 01:17:11 ) This is what I wanted to do. You love this country, are you willing to do the hard work it takes to maintain it?  Lakeisha Cole: ( 01:17:21 ) What was supposed to be a six month deployment actually turned into 11 months. There was nothing really to prepare me as a new military spouse on how to deal with the stress.  Speaker 24: ( 01:17:33 ) When people get married, they expect to grow with each other. With multiple combat tours, there’s no guarantee of any of those things.  Lakeisha Cole: ( 01:17:42 ) They’re just a long laundry list of uncertainties that we have to juggle.  Stacey Abrams: ( 01:17:49 ) Joe has always cared about military families. They’ve been through so much. When I went to Iraq, one of the generals said, ” I want to share the story with you.” In his daughter’s class, it was a Christmas program and they were playing the Ave Maria. And one of the little girls burst into tears and the teacher ran over and said, “What’s the matter? What’s the matter?” And she said, “That’s the song they played at my daddy’s funeral. He died in the war.” The teacher had no idea that that little girl’s father had fought in the war and had died. And that night I said to my staff, I’m a teacher, we can do better. We’ve got to do better to help our military kids.  Lakeisha Cole: ( 01:18:36 ) The Bidens have a track record of helping military families. And we’ve seen it with their work that they’ve done with joining forces, and how they were able to rally a country behind us.  Joe Biden: ( 01:18:48 ) Then when we send the war to defend our nation, care for them and their families while they’re gone, and care for them and their families when they come home.  Lakeisha Cole: ( 01:18:59 ) It was the very first time that I, as a military spouse, felt like someone was listening to us, and someone cared.  Stacey Abrams: ( 01:19:07 ) It’s not just the service member who serves, the entire family serves as well. Joe said, “We have one sacred obligation, to take care of our military members.” During this pandemic for sure, so many veterans have lost their jobs. So many military spouses have lost their jobs. That’s one of the things that will be a priority in a Biden administration. We will make sure that all Americans have healthcare employment. The things that families need to thrive.  Lakeisha Cole: ( 01:19:47 ) When people show you who they are, believe them the first time. And we know exactly who Joe is. He is the best candidate for America, not just for our families.  Tammy Duckworth: ( 01:20:12 ) Good evening. I’m Tammy Duckworth. When I first enlisted in the army, I was eager to serve my country, yet anxious whether I’d be able to earn my way into the ranks. But I earned my wings, and later commanded my own air assault unit, learning that serving and leading in the military is both a privilege and a sacrifice. To be a commander, you must always put your troops first, because one day you may order them to sacrifice everything for our great nation to do that, leaders must command their troops respect and be worthy of their pledge to protect and defend our constitution. No matter the cost, but military service, doesn’t just take sacrifice from those in uniform. It’s required from their families too. My husband Brian was the one who rushed to Walter Reed. After I was wounded in Iraq, he was the one holding my hand, waiting for me to wake up.  Tammy Duckworth: ( 01:21:03 ) And when I finally did, he was my rock, getting me through those hours, weeks, months of unspeakable pain and unending surgeries. He was my anchor as I relearned to walk, helping me through every step and every stumble. Our military spouses hold their families together, praying for their loved ones safety, wherever they’re deployed and serving as caregivers to our disabled service members. And then picking up the pieces and starting again, whenever the next tour or the next war arises, Joe Biden understands the sacrifices because he’s made them himself. When his son Beau deployed to Iraq, his burden was also shouldered by his family. Joe knows the fear military families live because he’s felt that dread of never knowing if your deployed loved one is safe. He understands their bravery because he has had to muster that same strength. Every hour of every day Beau was overseas. That’s the kind of leader our service members deserve.  Tammy Duckworth: ( 01:22:05 ) One who understands the risks they face and who would actually protect them by doing his job as commander in chief. Instead they have a coward in chief who won’t stand up to a flatter me, a Putin read his daily intelligence briefings, or even publicly admonish adversaries for reportedly putting bounties on our troops heads. As president, Joe Biden would never let tyrants manipulate him like a puppet. He would never pervert our military to stroke his own ego. He would never turn his back on our troops or threaten them against Americans, peacefully exercising. Their constitutional rights. Joe Biden would stand up for what’s right, stand tall for our troops, and stand strong against our enemies. Because unlike Trump, Joe Biden has common decency. He has common sense. He can command, both from experience, and from strength. Donald Trump doesn’t deserve to call himself commander in chief for another four minutes, let alone another four years. Our troops deserve better. Our country deserves better. If you agree, text more to 30330 to elect Joe Biden, a leader who actually cares enough about America to lead.  Beau Biden: ( 01:23:26 ) Good evening. I’m Beau Biden. And Joe Biden is my dad.  Speaker 25: ( 01:23:33 ) Some voices are never silenced. Some work never ceases to change lives. Some people never stop inspiring, even after they’re gone. Beau Biden was a husband, father, brother, son, soldier, attorney general. He was given just 46 years on this earth.  Barack Obama: ( 01:23:58 ) He did in 46 years with most of us couldn’t do in 146. Think about the day that dawns for children who are safer because of Beau. Whose lives are fuller, because of him. Think about the day of the dawns for parents who rest easier, and families who are freer because of him. Some folks may never know that their lives are better because of Beau Biden, but that’s okay. Certainly for Beau, acclaim was never the point of public service.  Speaker 25: ( 01:24:27 ) If you knew Beau, you knew he lived by the strictest code of honor, duty, service, country. You never had to ask if he would do something the right way. He didn’t know any other way.  Barack Obama: ( 01:24:41 ) Beau didn’t cut corners. He turned down an appointment to be Delaware’s attorney general so he could win it fair and square. When the field was clear for him to run for the Senate, he chose to finish his job as AG instead. After 9/11, he joined the National Guard. He felt it was his obligation. He did his duty to his country, and deployed to Iraq.  Speaker 25: ( 01:25:06 ) Beau Biden served his country in battle. He prosecuted one of the worst child predators in American history. And even though he is no longer with us, every day he still inspires the next president of the United States.  Beau Biden: ( 01:25:21 ) It won’t be possible for me to be here this fall. So I have something to ask of you, be there for my dad like he was for me.  Julia Louis-Dreyfus: ( 01:25:37 ) A couple of years ago, I was diagnosed with cancer. And I was absolutely terrified. One of the first people who called me was Joe. His real warmth and kindness on that call, man, I got to say, it made me cry. Our current president has made me cry too, but it’s never had anything to do with his warmth or kindness. Joe Biden’s empathy is genuine. You can feel it. That’s why president Obama asked Joe to head up the Cancer Moonshot. President Obama knows what we all know. Joe Biden understands suffering and loss and sacrifice. Mayor Pete Buttigieg also knows something about sacrifice. He volunteered and was deployed to Afghanistan, then returned home to Indiana to become a highly effective public servant. Say hi to Mayor Pete.  Pete Buttigieg: ( 01:26:42 ) Good evening. Beau Biden lived a life of service. In office, and in uniform. When you put your life on the line for this country, you do it, not because it’s the country you live in, but because it’s a country you believe in. I believe in this country, because America uniquely holds the promise of a place where everyone can belong. We know that for too many, and for too long, that promise has been denied. But we also know America is at its best when we make that circle of belonging wider. Just over 10 years ago, I joined a military where firing me because of who I am wasn’t just possible, it was policy. Now, in 2020, it is unlawful in America to fire someone because of who they are, or who they love. The very ring on my finger, a wedding we celebrated, here where I’m standing, reflects how this country can change. Love makes my marriage real, but political courage made it possible, including that of Joe Biden, who stepped out ahead even of this party, when he said that marriage equality ought to be the law of the land.  Pete Buttigieg: ( 01:28:02 ) There is a long way to go. But if this much can change between 2010 and 2020, imagine what could change between now and 2030. Imagine what we could achieve. This coalition we are building this very season gathering progresses and moderates, independents, and even what I like to call future former Republicans standing for an America where everyone belongs. Joe Biden is right. This is a contest for the soul of the nation. And to me, that contest is not between good Americans and evil Americans. It’s the struggle to call out what is good in every American. It’s up to us. Will America be a place where faith is about healing and not exclusion? Can we become a country that lives up to the truth that black lives matter? Will we handle questions of science and medicine by turning to scientists and doctors? Will we see to it that no one who works full time can live in poverty  Pete Buttigieg: ( 01:29:14 ) I trust Joe Biden and Kamala Harris to guide us toward that better future, because I’ve seen up close their empathy, and their capacity. Just as I’ve seen my fellow Americans capacity to support, and include one another in new ways and do better by the promise of America. The day I was born, the idea of an out candidate seeking any federal office at all was laughable. Yet earlier this year, I campaigned for the presidency often with my husband, Chasten at my side, winning delegates to this very convention. Now I come to this convention proudly supporting Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, joining fellow Democrats who were squaring off in competition just a few months ago. A number of us recently got together to talk about the Joe we know.  Cory Booker: ( 01:30:13 ) Hi, I’m Cory Booker. Welcome to everybody at home. I am very excited to present to you a group of people that ran in the 2020 democratic primary against Joe Biden. You could think of this sort of like Survivor on the out interviews of all the people that got voted off the island. Bernie, don’t you laugh, because I got questions for you. Like why does my girlfriend like you more than she likes me?  Bernie Sanders: ( 01:30:39 ) Because she’s smarter than you and that’s the obvious answer, right?  Cory Booker: ( 01:30:44 ) Hey, I’m curious, because Senator Sanders, and Senator Klobuchar, you actually served with Joe Biden in the Senate. I’m wondering if you have any memories of what he was like as a colleague in the Senate.  Amy Klobuchar: ( 01:30:56 ) I remember one night when I was giving one of those floor speeches, and Cory, you know what this is like. No one was there, no one was watching. I was all alone. And I gave my speech with much vigor to a completely empty chamber. And I walked out of there and I thought, “I wonder if my mom was even watching this on C-SPAN.” And at that moment, the cell phone rings. And I actually thought maybe my mom was watching it on C-SPAN. And you know who it was? It was Joe Biden. And that kind of goes to not only his kindness for calling me and being a mentor, but it also goes to how much he cares about our government and what people are saying. And that even when he’s at home at night, he’s watching, and he cares.  Bernie Sanders: ( 01:31:41 ) But Amy, we all want to know, did your mother watch the speech?  Pete Buttigieg: ( 01:31:45 ) Do you remember the steak fry when we were waiting to go on? It worked out to where I was there the same time he was. And he pulled me aside at one point, and he pointed to somebody who we both knew who was working on my campaign, but he’d known from before. And let me know that that was somebody who had gone through a family tragedy, that Joe somehow knew about. And just thought it was important for me to know that about someone who is working with me. Over time, I realized that that was just basic to who he is, but that always stuck with me.  Cory Booker: ( 01:32:18 ) Elizabeth, do you have any remembrances as well?  Elizabeth Warren: ( 01:32:21 ) I think the day I saw Joe the clearest was on the one year anniversary of the Boston Marathon bombing. And everyone of course was enormously honored to have the vice president here. But at some point in that speech, he shifted to the parent who had lost a child, to the man who had lost a wife, to someone who had experienced loss very personally. And he spoke to each of the families from the heart.  Cory Booker: ( 01:32:58 ) That’s phenomenal. I want to ask what gets you excited about this idea of the inclusion of big ideas from all over the party into the future and to the next administration?  Andrew Yang: ( 01:33:10 ) The magic of Joe Biden is that everything he does becomes the new reasonable. If he comes with an ambitious plan to address climate change, all of a sudden everyone’s going to follow his lead. You can see it wit him choosing Kamala too. He wants to build the best team. Let’s do it together. That’s how we’re going to rebuild this country.  Beto O’Rourke: ( 01:33:28 ) Cory, I’m so optimistic about our country right now, despite some very dark days for a lot of our fellow Americans, in large part because of what young people are doing right now. After the murder of Ahmaud Arbery, and Breonna Taylor, and George Floyd. Young people, by and large led these protests. And they did so in the absolute best traditions of this country. And the tradition of John Lewis. My optimism and my faith in this country is reflected in those young people. And the way that Joe and Kamala are listening to them and incorporating their ideas and their urgency into the campaign that they’re running and the administration that they’re going to lead.  Cory Booker: ( 01:34:12 ) And I often think some people will say they don’t know if they’re going to vote or not, or saying that from a point of privilege that a lot of Americans don’t have. There are so many things for lots of folks who live life on the margins that this election is going to decide, and maybe it’s not a life or death issue for you, but we are all in this together.  Beto O’Rourke: ( 01:34:29 ) Absolutely.  Bernie Sanders: ( 01:34:30 ) Cory, what I would say is that this is clearly the most important election in the modern history of this country. And Joe Biden, you have a human being who is empathetic, who is honest, who is decent. And at this particular moment in American history, my God, that is something that this country absolutely needs. And all of us, whether you’re progressives, whether your moderates or conservatives have got the come together to defeat this president.  Cory Booker: ( 01:35:04 ) Thanks for that, Bernie. I want to thank you all for joining us for this segment. I mean this sincerely, it was an honor to run against you, and then there’s even a greater honor to stand with you and support of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris.  Mike Bloomberg: ( 01:35:20 ) Good evening. I’ve never been much for partisan politics. I’ve supported Democrats Republicans and independents. Hell, I’ve actually been a Democrat, Republican, and independent. It’s all about people. And the two people running for president couldn’t be more different. One believes in facts, one does not. One listens to experts, the other things he knows everything. One looks forward and sees strength in America’s diversity. The other looks backwards and sees immigrants as enemies, and white supremacists as allies. Here’s another difference. One has proven he knows how to handle a crisis by helping to lead the economic turnaround after the 2008 recession, while the other has not only failed to lead, he has made the current crisis much worse. When confronted with the biggest calamity any president has faced in the modern era, Donald Trump spent the year downplaying the threat, ignoring science, and recommending quack cures, which let COVID-19 spread much faster than it should have, leaving hundreds of thousands needlessly sick or dead.  Mike Bloomberg: ( 01:36:34 ) He has failed the American people catastrophically. Four years ago, I came before this very convention and said New Yorkers know a con when we see one. But tonight, I’m not asking you to vote against Donald Trump because he’s a bad guy. I’m urging you to vote against him because he’s done a bad job. Today, unemployment is at historic highs, and small businesses are struggling just to survive. It didn’t have to be this way. Before I ran for mayor, I spent 20 years running a business I started from scratch. So I want to ask small business owners and their employees one question, and it’s a question for everyone. Would you rehire, or work for someone who ran your business into the ground? And who always does what’s best for him or her, even when it hurts the company? And whose reckless decisions put you in danger, and who spends more time Tweeting than working? If the answer is no, why the hell would we ever rehire Donald Trump for another four years?  Mike Bloomberg: ( 01:37:44 ) Trump says we should vote for him because he’s a great businessman. Really? He drove his companies into bankruptcy six times, always leaving behind customers and contractors who were cheated and swindled and stopped doing business with him. Well this time, all of us are paying the price, and we can’t let him get away with it again. Donald says we should vote for him because the economy was great before the virus. Huh? Biden and Obama created more jobs over their last three years than the Trump administration did over their first three. And economic growth was higher under Biden and Obama than under Trump. In fact, while Biden helped save one million auto industry jobs, Trump has lost 250,000 manufacturing jobs.  Mike Bloomberg: ( 01:38:33 ) So when Trump says he wants to make America great again, he’s making a pretty good case for Joe Biden. Look, our goal shouldn’t be to bring back the pandemic economy. It should be as Joe says, to build it back better. Joe’s economic plan will create clean energy jobs that help fight another crisis that Trump is ignoring, climate change, and Joe will rebuild our crumbling roads and bridges, something Trump has incessantly talked about doing, but in the last…  Mike Bloomberg: ( 01:39:03 ) Something Trump has incessantly talked about doing, but in the last three and a half years, he hasn’t done anything. What a joke. And let me tell you a little secret. Donald Trump’s economic plan was to give a huge tax cut to guys like me who didn’t need it, and then lie about it to everyone else. Well, Joe will roll back that tax cut that I got, so we can fund things our whole country needs, like training for adults who have lost jobs and making college more affordable and investing in American research and development, so that the products of tomorrow are made today by American workers. Growing up, I was taught to believe that America is the greatest country in the world, not because we won the Second World War, but because of why we fought it, for freedom, democracy and equality.  Mike Bloomberg: ( 01:39:55 ) My favorite childhood book was called Johnny Tremain, about a Boston boy who joins the Sons of Liberty at the dawn of the American Revolution. At the end of the book, Johnny stands on Lexington Commons and sees a nation that is, quote, “Green with spring, dreaming of the future.” That’s the America I know and love. And that’s the America we are in danger of losing under this President. So let’s put an end to this whole sorry chapter in American history and elect leaders who will bring integrity and stability, sanity and competence back to the White House. Joe and Kamala, go get him for all of us.  Julia Louis-Dreyfus: ( 01:40:42 ) We can help you find the best and safest way to vote in your state. Simply text Vote to 30330 to learn more. 30330. It’s actually not that hard to remember. Watch. Person, woman, man, camera, TV, 30330. Anyone can do it. I want to introduce you now to a young man who Vice President Biden met earlier this year in New Hampshire and helped to find his voice. Say hello to Brayden Harrington.  Brayden Harrington: ( 01:41:18 ) Hi. My name is Brayden Harrington and I am 13 years old. And without Joe Biden, I wouldn’t be talking to you today. About a few months ago, I met him in New Hampshire. He told me that we were members of the same club. We stutter. It was really amazing to hear that someone like me became Vice President. He told me about a book of poems by Yeats he would read out loud to practice. He showed me how he marks his addresses to make them easier to say out loud. So I did the same thing today. And now I’m here talking to you today about the future, about our future.  Brayden Harrington: ( 01:42:23 ) My family often says when the world feels better, before talking about something normal, like going to the movies. We all want the world to feel better. We need the world to feel better. I’m just a regular kid. And in the short amount of time, Joe Biden made [inaudible 01:42:48] more confident about something that’s bothered me my whole life. Joe Biden cared. Imagine what he could do for all of us. Kids like me are counting on you to elect someone we can all look up to, someone who cares, someone who will make our country and the world feel better. We’re counting on you to elect Joe Biden.  Michael Beals: ( 01:43:12 ) The first time I met Joe, I was really new at my synagogue and I had to do a funeral service and a [foreign language 00:04:27]. And towards the end of the service, the door opens up. This person who was much younger than these octogenarians who were there walked in the room. It was our US Senator, Joe Biden. He was just very respectful. And he stayed in the back and his head was bowed in reverence. And at the end, I said, “Senator Biden. Why are you here?” Because how does a nice Irish Catholic boy know from [foreign language 01:43:52]? And what he said was just so lovely. He said, “This dear lady gave $18 to my campaign from the very first time I started in 1972.” So he wanted to show his respect by saying thank you. And that just blew me away.  Speaker 26: ( 01:44:10 ) [inaudible 00:05:16]. I think you guys might have though we were smaller [crosstalk 00:01:44:19].  Speaker 27: ( 01:44:23 ) Yeah.  Speaker 28: ( 01:44:23 ) Joe Biden’s granddaughter interview, take one.  Speaker 26: ( 01:44:25 ) No, no. This is good.  Speaker 28: ( 01:44:26 ) Okay [inaudible 00:01:44:26]. Good.  Speaker 29: ( 01:44:26 ) Okay. So what don’t I know about your grandfather?  Speaker 27: ( 01:44:32 ) He’s always eating ice cream. Usually it’s vanilla, with chocolate.  Speaker 30: ( 01:44:38 ) Sprinkles.  Speaker 27: ( 01:44:38 ) With Chocolate sprinkles.  Speaker 26: ( 01:44:39 ) Vanilla on a regular night.  Speaker 30: ( 01:44:41 ) No, no. With chocolate chip.  Speaker 27: ( 01:44:42 ) But no, [crosstalk 01:44:42]-  Speaker 30: ( 01:44:43 ) Chocolate and the Breyer’s that have half chocolate and half vanilla. He likes ice cream in hidden ways.  Speaker 27: ( 01:44:48 ) Yeah.  Speaker 31: ( 01:44:48 ) Yeah.  Speaker 27: ( 01:44:49 ) Eating it in the freezer so that my grandma doesn’t see.  Speaker 30: ( 01:44:54 ) Yeah. He eats it [crosstalk 01:44:52].  Speaker 27: ( 01:44:54 ) He hides it.  Speaker 29: ( 01:44:55 ) How often does it call you?  Speaker 30: ( 01:44:56 ) Every day.  Speaker 26: ( 01:44:57 ) Yeah, every day.  Speaker 30: ( 01:44:59 ) If we don’t talk to him for a day, it’s-  Speaker 31: ( 01:45:01 ) He’ll ask what’s wrong.  Speaker 30: ( 01:45:02 ) Yeah, yeah.  Speaker 26: ( 01:45:02 ) He’ll think we’re not alive.  Speaker 31: ( 01:45:04 ) He always calls with the same energy, even after he’s just done 15 interviews in a row. Hi, Pop. I was just talking about you.  Speaker 26: ( 01:45:13 ) I don’t necessarily pick up every day, but I have a lot of voicemails.  Speaker 30: ( 01:45:17 ) He will pick up our calls no matter where he is. He’d be onstage giving a speech and we’d call him and he’d be like, “What’s wrong? Is everything good?” We’ll be like, “No.”  Speaker 27: ( 01:45:26 ) “Just fine. [crosstalk 01:45:26].”  Speaker 31: ( 01:45:26 ) We’re [crosstalk 01:45:26].  Speaker 29: ( 01:45:29 ) What does the word family mean to you?  Speaker 30: ( 01:45:31 ) It’s a lot of time together. We’ve grown up together. He’s made sure that every single tradition, every holiday, we’re all together. I don’t think that there’s been any decision, no matter how big or small, that we haven’t decided as a family.  Speaker 27: ( 01:45:49 ) Pop told us that this election would be totally different from any other election ever. He was worried how it would affect his kids,  Speaker 26: ( 01:45:57 ) Whether or not we wanted to go through another campaign and be scrutinized by the press.  Speaker 31: ( 01:46:02 ) There had been talks of a big meeting coming.  Speaker 30: ( 01:46:04 ) It’s normally called by the parents, I would say. But this time it was called by me.  Speaker 26: ( 01:46:09 ) I came down from Penn and Maisie came up from DC and my cousins lived down the road.  Speaker 30: ( 01:46:13 ) He thought we were calling a meeting sort of to discuss whether or not we wanted him to, but really we were calling it to be like, “Get in that race. Hurry up.”  Speaker 27: ( 01:46:23 ) We just knew that he had to run and we weren’t going to take No as an answer.  Speaker 30: ( 01:46:31 ) At the end of the day, I think we’re all very happy we had that meeting.  Joe Biden: ( 01:46:37 ) All right. Well, when you get back there, give me a call, and so tell how the whole thing went. Okay?  Speaker 31: ( 01:46:39 ) Okay, I will.  Joe Biden: ( 01:46:41 ) I love you, baby.  Speaker 31: ( 01:46:41 ) I love you too.  Ayesha Curry: ( 01:46:43 ) We want to ensure that our kids live in a nation that is safe, happy, healthy and fair. And so this election…  Stephen Curry: ( 01:46:51 ) We’re voting for Joe Biden. And let’s have a conversation with these kids.  Ayesha Curry: ( 01:46:57 ) Let’s do it. So let’s jump right in, shall we?  Ryan Curry: ( 01:47:00 ) What does jump in mean?  Speaker 32: ( 01:47:03 ) [inaudible 00:01:47:01].  Ryan Curry: ( 01:47:04 ) Mommy, I can’t be quiet.  Ayesha Curry: ( 01:47:06 ) Why?  Ryan Curry: ( 01:47:06 ) [inaudible 00:01:47:07].  Ayesha Curry: ( 01:47:08 ) I don’t want you to be quiet. You deserve to speak and say whatever it is that comes to your mind in this moment right now. Every election is important. This upcoming election is especially important. One, because the social injustices right now, racial inequality, but also because we have children.  Ryan Curry: ( 01:47:27 ) Excuse me, Mommy.  Ayesha Curry: ( 01:47:28 ) Yes.  Ryan Curry: ( 01:47:29 ) I need to go to the bathroom.  Ayesha Curry: ( 01:47:30 ) Okay.  Stephen Curry: ( 01:47:32 ) Do you want to go right now? Do you know where the President lives?  Ryan Curry: ( 01:47:36 ) In the White House?  Riley Curry: ( 01:47:38 ) Washington, DC.  Stephen Curry: ( 01:47:40 ) Do you know what the President’s job is?  Ryan Curry: ( 01:47:45 ) To tell what happened to the world?  Stephen Curry: ( 01:47:49 ) That’s good. That’s a good one.  Riley Curry: ( 01:47:50 ) Keep the environment safe?  Stephen Curry: ( 01:47:53 ) That is correct.  Ayesha Curry: ( 01:47:55 ) That’s correct.  Stephen Curry: ( 01:47:55 ) As we say, that is correct.  Ryan Curry: ( 01:47:57 ) That is correct.  Riley Curry: ( 01:47:57 ) That is correct.  Ayesha Curry: ( 01:47:57 ) Correct.  Ayesha Curry: ( 01:48:00 ) If you could create the ideal person to lead this country, what characteristics would that person have?  Riley Curry: ( 01:48:08 ) A very kind personality.  Ayesha Curry: ( 01:48:12 ) What would you like to see taking care of the people?  Riley Curry: ( 01:48:14 ) I would like to see them taking care of the Earth and the people.  Stephen Curry: ( 01:48:20 ) So girls, it is 2020 and the election is coming up in November. Do you know who is running for President?  Riley Curry: ( 01:48:30 ) Joe Biden.  Stephen Curry: ( 01:48:30 ) Yeah.  Riley Curry: ( 01:48:30 ) And…  Ayesha Curry: ( 01:48:36 ) Exactly. That’s it. This video’s over.  Stephen Curry: ( 01:48:39 ) What would you say if you knew that Joe Biden was going to have a woman as his Vice President?  Riley Curry: ( 01:48:48 ) Surprised and happy.  Stephen Curry: ( 01:48:49 ) Why?  Riley Curry: ( 01:48:52 ) There’s not a lot of women being President and helping alongside the President.  Stephen Curry: ( 01:49:03 ) How important do you think your faith is in the way that you live your life?  Riley Curry: ( 01:49:08 ) Really big, because I’m grateful for all the things that I have and that I love my family.  Ayesha Curry: ( 01:49:16 ) And with that said, everyone, we really thank you, one, for listening to this very candid conversation with our daughters. And we just want to encourage you to truly do your research. Think about your own homes and what you’d like to see projected out into the world. And the right direction is making sure that you vote this election for Biden.  Ayesha Curry: ( 01:49:45 ) Whatever you do, please vote. Every vote counts. Just remember that.  Ayesha Curry: ( 01:49:53 ) You’re going to dance out?  Speaker 32: ( 01:49:54 ) And cut.  Julia Louis-Dreyfus: ( 01:49:58 ) Here’s the big question. How much of your time and energy are you willing to devote to elect Joe Biden? Here’s my answer. I’m going all in. Look. Elections can break your heart, but sometimes they can make you sing from the mountaintops. And this year, we’re going to sing. This year, we’re going to elect a President who’s honest, experienced and intelligent, a President who actually believes in the rule of law, who will restore dignity and normalcy to the White House and the soul of this nation. And boy, won’t that be something. One of my favorite things Joe Biden says is that you can succeed in life without sacrificing your ideals or your commitment to family. So who better to introduce our nominee, Joe Biden, than his children.  Hunter Biden: ( 01:50:52 ) I’m Hunter Biden.  Ashley Biden: ( 01:50:54 ) And I’m Ashley Biden.  Hunter Biden: ( 01:50:55 ) Joe Biden is our dad.  Ashley Biden: ( 01:50:57 ) And Beau is our brother.  Hunter Biden: ( 01:50:59 ) We want to tell you what kind of President our dad will be.  Ashley Biden: ( 01:51:01 ) He will be tough.  Hunter Biden: ( 01:51:03 ) And honest.  Ashley Biden: ( 01:51:04 ) Caring and principled.  Hunter Biden: ( 01:51:06 ) He’ll listen. He’ll be there when you need him.  Ashley Biden: ( 01:51:09 ) He’ll tell you the truth, even when you don’t want to hear it,  Hunter Biden: ( 01:51:12 ) He’ll never let you down.  Ashley Biden: ( 01:51:13 ) He’ll be rock steady.  Hunter Biden: ( 01:51:15 ) The strongest shoulder you can ever lean on.  Ashley Biden: ( 01:51:18 ) He’ll beam with pride every time you succeed.  Hunter Biden: ( 01:51:22 ) He’ll make your grandkids feel that what they’ve got to say matters.  Ashley Biden: ( 01:51:26 ) He’ll treat everyone with respect, no matter who you are.  Hunter Biden: ( 01:51:30 ) He’ll get up no matter how many times he’s been knocked down.  Ashley Biden: ( 01:51:33 ) He’ll be the worst enemy any bully ever saw.  Hunter Biden: ( 01:51:36 ) He’ll be the best friend you’ve ever had.  Ashley Biden: ( 01:51:38 ) He’ll love you with all of his heart.  Hunter Biden: ( 01:51:41 ) And if you give him your cell phone number…  Ashley Biden: ( 01:51:43 ) He’s going to call it.  Hunter Biden: ( 01:51:45 ) How do we know?  Ashley Biden: ( 01:51:46 ) Because he’s been that way our whole life.  Hunter Biden: ( 01:51:49 ) He’s been a great father.  Ashley Biden: ( 01:51:51 ) And we think he’ll be a great President.  Hunter Biden: ( 01:51:55 ) Beau isn’t with us any longer.  Ashley Biden: ( 01:51:57 ) But he is still very much alive in our hearts, and we can still hear his strong voice.  Hunter Biden: ( 01:52:03 ) Just like it was yesterday.  Ashley Biden: ( 01:52:05 ) Just like it was yesterday.  Hunter Biden: ( 01:52:08 ) In 2008 and 2012, he introduced our dad at those conventions.  Ashley Biden: ( 01:52:13 ) And if he was here, we’re pretty sure we’d know what he’d say.  Hunter Biden: ( 01:52:18 ) So before we show you a film about our dad’s journey, we wanted to give Beau the last word. Beau.  Ashley Biden: ( 01:52:25 ) Beau, take it away.  Beau Biden: ( 01:52:27 ) In moment’s both public and private, he’s the father I’ve always known, the grandfather my children love and adore. My father, my hero, Joe Biden.  Speaker 33: ( 01:53:08 ) Our lives have been turned upside down, shattered and shaken. But the American story has had moments like this before. And he was there answering the call.  Barack Obama: ( 01:53:28 ) When we came into office in 2009, we were going through what was then the worst financial and economic crisis since the Great Depression.  Speaker 34: ( 01:53:37 ) The economy was hemorrhaging 100s of 1000s of jobs a week. People were losing their homes to foreclosure. The financial system was in tatters. Auto sales had dropped to near zero levels.  Speaker 33: ( 01:53:54 ) The auto companies faced bankruptcy and many said, “Let them fail.” But Joe remembered his father and what it meant to lose a job. The Finnegans and Bidens were Irish Catholic. Joe was their first, and then his sister, Valerie.  Valerie Biden Owens: ( 01:54:29 ) From the moment I opened my eyes, my big brother was there. The thing that was most important was family and family and family.  Speaker 33: ( 01:54:42 ) As the post-war boom faded, Joe’s father struggled to find work in Scranton, but 140 miles south, there was a job, cleaning boilers in Wilmington.  Valerie Biden Owens: ( 01:54:54 ) There was a long stairway up to the second floor. Dad went up to Joey in our bedroom and saying, “Joey, you got to be a big boy.”  Speaker 33: ( 01:55:06 ) For the first time, Joe saw the heavy burden on a father and it was a lesson he would never forget.  Valerie Biden Owens: ( 01:55:14 ) A job is a lot more than a paycheck. It’s about dignity.  Speaker 33: ( 01:55:20 ) The country was losing 10s of 1000s of jobs a day and they needed three votes to pass the Economic Rescue Package.  Speaker 34: ( 01:55:28 ) Joe Biden was handed to the task of going to get those three Republican votes.  Speaker 33: ( 01:55:34 ) Joe returned to the place where he had been so effective.  Speaker 34: ( 01:55:38 ) Passionate argument, sympathetic listening, a willingness to make adjustments and accommodations to bring people on board.  Speaker 33: ( 01:55:46 ) When the law finally passed, the President tapped his partner to run the program. Joe tracked every dollar, calling mayors and governors.  Speaker 34: ( 01:55:57 ) Talking to them on the phone one-on-one. He gave all of them his cell phone.  Cecillia Munoz: ( 01:56:01 ) And I watched him bring his heart to that job. It matters that you have in your mind the family that you’re trying to reach, the neighborhood that you’re trying to reach, the people whose lives are affected by what you do.  Speaker 33: ( 01:56:16 ) The skills that had made him so effective had not come easy. When he entered school, there was a problem. Joe had a stutter.  Joe Biden: ( 01:56:27 ) And it’s mortifying. It allows that child to become an object to ridicule.  Speaker 33: ( 01:56:33 ) When his teacher mimicked him and Joe ran home from school, his mother drove him back.  Joe Biden: ( 01:56:38 ) “Did you say to my son, Mr. Biden?” My mom said. “I was just trying to make a point.” My mother stood up, all 5 foot 2 of her. “If you ever talked to my son like that again, I’ll come back and rip that damn bonnet off your head. Do you understand me? Joey, go back to class.”  Speaker 33: ( 01:56:55 ) Joe resolved to overcome his stutter.  Joe Biden: ( 01:56:57 ) Some letters are harder than others. And I used to get up at night and go stand in front of the mirror with a flashlight and practice. She’d make me look her in the eye. “Look at me. Remember, Joey, you’re the smartest boy in that class. Nobody’s better than you, Joey.” From having to deal with stuttering, it gave me insight into other people’s pain, other people’s suffering.  Speaker 33: ( 01:57:27 ) At 19, Joe sought out a summer job that few of his peers considered taking.  Speaker 35: ( 01:57:32 ) He was a lifeguard along with the Black lifeguards. That’s when I first seen Joe and we became friends.  Joe Biden: ( 01:57:39 ) It was one of the best things I’ve ever done, because it gave me a sense that we really didn’t know one another.  Speaker 33: ( 01:57:45 ) After Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated, riots broke out in Wilmington and the National Guard stayed for almost a year.  Joe Biden: ( 01:57:56 ) I quit the law firm and asked for a job to become a public defender. That’s what sort of got me involved in politics.  Speaker 33: ( 01:58:05 ) J. Caleb Boggs was a popular war hero in a solidly Republican state and few took Joe’s campaign seriously.  Valerie Biden Owens: ( 01:58:13 ) In Delaware, the Democratic party was non-functional. When it got time to put up a candidate, they didn’t want to touch it. This young upstart, Joe Biden, who had a lot of ideas and no money, no influence, the Party said, “Okay. Well, then go ahead, Biden. Give it a whirl.”  Speaker 36: ( 01:58:34 ) That’s [inaudible 01:58:35].  Joe Biden: ( 01:58:35 ) That’s all I can add. You’re going to [inaudible 01:58:37] you see. Help me out. If not, vote for the other fellow. But look me over if you would.  Speaker 37: ( 01:58:40 ) We’d have a coffee and we’d come out of that, we’d have five more coffees. He was very articulate on the issues. He brought people to say not just that, “Boy, I agree with what you’re doing.” It’s “What can I do to help?”  Speaker 38: ( 01:58:52 ) Delaware is the first state. J. Caleb Boggs who is the incumbent, Republican, being challenged by Joseph Biden. Biden is a Democrat who is 29 years of age.  Speaker 33: ( 01:59:06 ) But exhilaration soon turned to tragedy.  Speaker 37: ( 01:59:10 ) I mean, it was clear he had decided that, “I’m not going to be a senator, that the boys need me too much.”  Joe Biden: ( 01:59:17 ) I was prepared to walk away in 1973. But men like Ted Kennedy and Mike Mansfield and Hubert Humphrey, Fritz Hollings, Danny Inouye, They convinced me to stay, “Just stay six months, Joe.” Remember, Danny? “Just stay six months.”  Valerie Biden Owens: ( 01:59:37 ) He couldn’t allow the suffering to debilitate him, just like he couldn’t allow the stuttering to define him. That’s the backbone. There’s something bigger than Joe suffering.  Speaker 37: ( 01:59:53 ) The Senate turned out to be a wonderful place for him. He had a real gift for bringing people together.  Valerie Biden Owens: ( 02:00:05 ) The three of them had a bond that was forged in sorrow and expanded into joy when Jill entered.  Jill Biden: ( 02:00:14 ) They had built this beautiful family, this circle of trust.  Valerie Biden Owens: ( 02:00:20 ) And then the extra gift of Ashley.  Ashley Biden: ( 02:00:26 ) Growing up, it was full of adventure, laughter.  Hunter Biden: ( 02:00:31 ) We do everything as a family and we’ve always done everything as a family.  Jill Biden: ( 02:00:35 ) He was always a good loving father. I mean, there’s nothing more important to Joe than his children.  Hunter Biden: ( 02:00:42 ) It’s hard to explain how ever-present he was in our lives.  Beau Biden: ( 02:00:47 ) You don’t have to guess what my dad believes. A great benefit of being my father is that he doesn’t have to contort himself into different people at different times.  Valerie Biden Owens: ( 02:00:56 ) Beau was going to do fine things. I mean he had it all and then he got sick. The whole world tilted and it felt like we were all falling off.  Speaker 33: ( 02:01:12 ) Once again, Joe faced the unimaginable.  Joe Biden: ( 02:01:17 ) My mother, she said, “Bravery resides in every heart and someday it will be summoned.”  Hunter Biden: ( 02:01:31 ) The way he survived losing my mom and my sister and then losing my brother is understanding that you have to have purpose.  Joe Biden: ( 02:01:42 ) Every day I get up, I ask myself, I hope he’s proud of me because that’s [inaudible 02:01:49] makes me move on.  Speaker 33: ( 02:01:53 ) From his time in the Senate and then the White House, Joe always found a way forward, forging unlikely friendships and alliances. And time after time, he made progress possible and always holding in his heart, the struggles of his family and every family, always fighting to make his country whole.  Cecillia Munoz: ( 02:02:18 ) It’s a very rare quality to bring your empathy skills to the process of governing. Joe Biden never forgets that. That’s the point of moving the wheels of government.  Bernie Sanders: ( 02:02:31 ) He will keep his word. He will reach out and hear what other people have to say.  Barack Obama: ( 02:02:38 ) To have somebody who believes in what’s best in us? Someone like Joe Biden who actually believes in the American idea? That’s the kind of person who I want in the White House.  Joe Biden: ( 02:02:59 ) Good evening. Ella Baker, a giant of the civil rights movement, left us with this wisdom. “Give people light and they will find the way. Give people light.” Those are words for our time. The current President has cloaked America in darkness for much too long. Too much anger, too much fear, too much division. Here and now, I give you my word. If you entrust me with the presidency, I will draw on the best of us, not the worst. I’ll be an ally of the light, not the darkness. It’s time for us, for we the people, to come together. And make no mistake united we can and will overcome this season of darkness in America. We’ll choose hope over fear, facts over fiction, fairness over privilege. I’m a proud Democrat and I’ll be proud to carry the banner of our Party into the general election. So with great honor and humility, I accept this nomination for President of the United States of America.  Joe Biden: ( 02:04:17 ) But while I’ll be a Democratic candidate, I will be an American President. I’ll work hard for those who didn’t support me, as hard for them as I did for those who did vote for me. That’s the job of a President, to represent all of us, not just our base or our Party. This is not a partisan moment. This must be an American moment. Someone with the calls for hope and light and love, hope for our future, light to see our way forward and love for one another.  Joe Biden: ( 02:04:51 ) America isn’t just a collection of clashing interest of Red States or Blue States. We’re so much bigger than that. We’re so much better than that. Nearly a century ago, Franklin Roosevelt pledged the New Deal in a time of massive unemployment, uncertainty and fear. Stricken by a disease, stricken by a virus, FDR insisted that he would recover and prevail and he believed America could as well. And he did. And we can as well. This campaign isn’t just about winning votes. It’s about winning the heart and, yes, the soul of America, winning it for the generous among us, not the selfish, winning it for workers to keep this country going, not just the privileged few at the top, winning it for those communities who have known these injustice of a knee on the neck, for all the young people have known only America being of rising inequity and shrinking opportunity. They deserve the experience of America’s promise. They deserve to experience it in full.  Joe Biden: ( 02:06:05 ) No generation ever knows what history will ask of it. All we can ever know is whether we’re ready when that moment arrives. And now history has delivered us to one of the most difficult moments America’s ever faced. Four historic crises all at the same time, a perfect storm, the worst pandemic in over a 100 years, the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression, the most compelling call for racial justice since the ’60s and the undeniable realities and just the accelerating threats of climate change. So the question for us is simple. Are we ready? I believe we are. We must be.  Joe Biden: ( 02:06:55 ) All elections are important, but we know in our bones, this one is more consequential. As many have said, America is at an inflection point, a time of real peril, but also extraordinary possibilities. We can choose a path to becoming angrier, less hopeful, more divided, a path of shadow and suspicion, or… Or we can choose a different path and together take this chance to heal, to reform, to unite, a path of hope in light. This is a life-changing election. This will determine what America’s going to look like for a long, long time. Character’s on the ballot. Compassion is on a ballot. Decency, science, democracy, they’re all on the ballot,. who we are as a nation, what we stand for, and most importantly, who we want to be, that’s all on the ballot. And the choice could not be more clear.  Joe Biden: ( 02:07:59 ) No rhetoric is needed. Just judge this President on the facts. 5 million Americans infected by COVID-19, more than 170,000 Americans have died, by far the worst performance of any nation on Earth. More than 50 million people have filed for unemployment this year. More than 10 million people are going to lose their health insurance this year. Nearly one in six small businesses have closed this year. And this President, if he’s reelected, you know what will happen? Cases and deaths will remain far too high. More Mom and Pop business will close their doors, and this time for good. Working families will struggle to get by. And yet the wealthiest 1% will get 10s of billions of dollars in new tax breaks. And the assault on the Affordable Care Act will continue until it’s destroyed, taking insurance away for more than 20 million people, including more than 15 million people on Medicaid, and getting rid of the protections that President Obama worked so hard to get past for a 100 million more people who have preexisting conditions.  Joe Biden: ( 02:09:19 ) And speaking of President Obama, a man I was honored to serve alongside for eight years as Vice President, let me take this moment to say something we don’t say nearly enough. Thank you, Mr. President. You were a great President, a President that our children could and did look up to. No one’s going to say that about the current occupant of the White House. What we know about this President is that if he’s given four more years, he’ll be what he’s been for the last four years. The President takes no responsibility, refuses to lead, blames others, cozies up to dictators and fans the flames of hate and division. He’ll wake up every day believing that job is all about him, never about you. Is that the American you want for you, your family, your children? I see a different America, one that’s generous and strong, selfless and humble. It’s an America we could rebuild together.  Joe Biden: ( 02:10:23 ) As President, the first step I will take will be to get control of the virus that has ruined so many lives, because I understand something this President hasn’t from the beginning. We will never get our economy back on track, we will never get our kids safely back in schools, we’ll never have our lives back, until we deal with this virus. The tragedy of where we are today is it didn’t have to be this bad. Just look around. It’s not this bad in Canada or Europe or Japan or almost anywhere else in the world. And the President keeps telling us, “The virus is going to disappear.” He keeps waiting for a miracle. Well, I have news for him. No miracle is coming. We lead the world in confirmed cases. We lead the world in deaths. Our economy is in tatters with Black, Latino, Asian-American, native American communities bearing the brunt of it. And after all this time, the President still does not have a plan. Well, I do.  Joe Biden: ( 02:11:34 ) If I’m your President, on day one, we’ll implement the national strategy I’ve been laying out since March. We’ll develop and deploy rapid test with the results available immediately. We’ll make the medical supplies and protective equipment that our country needs. And we’ll make them here in America, so we will never again be at the mercy of China or other foreign countries in order to protect our own people. We’ll make sure our schools-  Joe Biden: ( 02:12:03 ) … and to protect our own people. We’ll make sure our schools have the resources they need to be open, safe, and effective. We’ll put politics aside, we’ll take the muzzle off our experts so the public gets the information they need and deserve, honest unvarnished truth. They can handle it. We’ll have a national mandate to wear a mask, not as a burden, but as a patriotic duty to protect one another. In short, we’ll do what we should have done from the very beginning. Our current president has failed in his most basic duty to the nation. He’s failed to protect us. He’s failed to protect America and my fellow Americans that is unforgivable. As president I’ll make you a promise, I’ll protect America, I will defend us from every attack seen and unseen, always without exception every time.  Joe Biden: ( 02:13:06 ) Look, I understand how hard it is to have any hope right now. On this summer night let me take a moment to speak to those of you who have lost the most. I have some idea how it feels to lose someone you love. I know that deep black hole that opens up in the middle of your chest and you feel like you’re being sucked into it. I know how mean and cruel and unfair life can be sometimes, but I’ve learned two things.  Joe Biden: ( 02:13:40 ) First, your loved one may have left this earth, but they’ll never leave your heart. They’ll always be with you, you’ll always hear them. And second, I found the best way through pain and loss and grief is to find purpose. As God’s children, each of us have a purpose in our lives. We have a great purpose as a nation to open the doors of opportunity to all Americans, to save our democracy, to be a light to the world once again, and finally to live up to and make real the words written in the sacred documents that founded this nation. That all men and women are created equal endowed by their creator with certain inalienable rights among them, life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.  Joe Biden: ( 02:14:36 ) My dad was an honorable decent man. He got knocked down a few times, pretty hard, but he always got back up. He worked hard and he built a great middle class life for our family. He used to say, “Joey, I don’t expect the government to solve my problems, but I sure in hell expect them to understand them.” Then he’d say, “Joey, a job is about a lot more than a paycheck. It’s about your dignity. It’s about respect. It’s about your place in the community. It’s about being able to look your kid in the eye and say, “Honey, it’s going to be okay, and mean it.”  Joe Biden: ( 02:15:16 ) I’ve never forgotten those lessons. That’s why my economic plan is all about jobs, dignity, respect, and community. Together we can, and we’ll rebuild our economy. And when we do, we’ll not only build back, we’ll build back better. With modern roads, bridges, highways, broadband, ports, and airports as a new foundation for economic growth with pipes to transport clean water to every community. With 5 million new manufacturing and technology jobs so the future is made in America.  Joe Biden: ( 02:15:53 ) Well, the healthcare system that lowers premiums, deductibles, drug prices. By building on the Affordable Care Act he’s trying to rip away. With an education system that trains our people for the best jobs of the 21st century. There’s not a single thing American workers can’t do. And with cost that doesn’t prevent young people from going to college, and student debt doesn’t crush them when they get out. With a childcare and eldercare system that makes it possible for parents to go to work and for the elderly to stay in their homes with dignity. With an immigration system that powers our economy and reflects our values. And with newly empowered labor unions, they’re the ones that built the middle class. With equal pay for women, with rising wages, you could raise a child on, a family on, and yes we’re going to do more than praise our essential workers.  Joe Biden: ( 02:16:55 ) We’re finally going to pay them, pay them. We can, and we will deal with climate change. It’s not only a crisis it’s an enormous opportunity. An opportunity for America to lead the world in clean energy and create millions of new, good paying jobs in the process. And we can pay for these investments by ending loopholes, unnecessary loopholes, and the president’s $1.3 trillion tax giveaway to the wealthiest 1% and the biggest, most profitable corporations, some of which do not pay any tax at all. Because we don’t need a tax code that rewards wealth more than it rewards work.  Joe Biden: ( 02:17:43 ) I’m not looking to punish anyone, far from it. But as long past time the wealthiest people and the biggest corporations in this country pay their fair share. And for our seniors, Social Security is a sacred obligation. A sacred promise made, they paid for. The current president is threatening to break that promise. He’s proposing to eliminate a tax that pays for almost half the Social Security without any way of making up for that loss revenue resulting in cuts. I will not let that happen. If I’m your president, we’re going to protect Social Security and Medicare. You have my word. One most powerful voices we hear in the country today is from our young people. They’re speaking to the inequity and injustice that has grown up in America. Economic injustice, racial injustice, environmental injustice. I hear their voices, if you listen you can hear them too. And whether it’s existential threat posed by climate change, the daily fear of being gunned down in school, or the inability to get started in your first job will be the work of the next president to restore the promise of America to everyone.  Joe Biden: ( 02:19:12 ) And I’m not going to have to do it alone because I’ll have a great vice president at my side, Senator Kamala Harris. She’s a powerful voice for this nation. Her story is the American story. She knows about all the obstacles thrown in the way of so many in our country, women, black women, black Americans, South Asian Americans, immigrants, the left out in the left behind, but she’s overcome every obstacle she’s ever faced. No one’s been tough around the big banks on the gun lobby. No one has been tougher in calling out the current administration for its extremism, it’s failure to follow the law, it’s failure to simply tell the truth. Kamala and I both draw from our families, that’s where we get our strength. For Kamala’s Doug and their families. For me, it’s Jill and ours. I’ve said many times, no man deserves one great love in his life let alone two. But I’ve known two. After losing my first wife in that car accident, Jill came into my life. She put our family back together. She’s an educator, a mom, a military mom, and an unstoppable force. If she puts her mind to it, just get out of the way she’s going to get it done. She was a great second lady. And I know she’ll make a great first lady for this nation. She loves this country so much. And I’ll always have the strength that can only come from family. Hunter, Ashley, all our grandchildren. My brothers, my sister, they give me courage, they lift me up.  Joe Biden: ( 02:21:03 ) While he’s no longer with us, Beau inspires me every day. Beau served our nation in uniform. A year in Iraq, a decorated Iraqi war veteran. So I take very personally the profound responsibility of serving as commander in chief.  Joe Biden: ( 02:21:26 ) I’ll be a president who’ll stand with our allies and friends and make it clear to our adversaries. The days of cozing up to dictators is over. Under president Biden America will not turn a blind eye to Russia bounties on the heads of American soldiers, nor will I put up with foreign interference in our most sacred democratic exercise, voting. And I’ll always stand for our values of human rights and dignity. I’ll work in common purpose for more secure, peaceful, and prosperous world. History has thrust one more urgent task on us. Will we be the generation that finally wipes out the stain of racism from our national character? I believe we’re up to it. I believe we’re ready.  Joe Biden: ( 02:22:26 ) Just a week ago, yesterday was the third anniversary of the events in Charlottesville. Close your eyes, remember what you saw on television. Remember seeing those Neo-Nazis and Klansmen and white supremacists coming out of fields with lighted torches, veins bulging, spewing the same antisemitic bile heard across Europe in the 30s. Remember the violent clash that ensued between those spreading hate and those with the courage to stand against it. Remember what the president said when asked, he said there were “very fine people on both sides.” That was a wake-up call for us as a country, and for me a call to action.  Joe Biden: ( 02:23:15 ) At that moment I knew I’d have to run because my father taught us that silence was complicity and I can never remain silent or complicit. At the time I said, we’re in the battle for the soul of this nation and we are. One of the most important conversations I’ve had this entire campaign. It was with someone who was much too young to vote. I met with six year old Giana Floyd, the day before her daddy, George Floyd was laid rest. She’s an incredibly brave little girl, and I’ll never forget it. When I leaned down to speak to her, she looked in my eyes and she said, “Daddy changed the world. Daddy changed the world.”  Joe Biden: ( 02:24:12 ) Her words burrowed deep into my heart. Maybe George Floyd murder was a breaking point. Maybe John Lewis is passing the inspiration, but however it’s come to be, however it’s happened, America’s ready in John’s words to lay down, “The heavy burden of hate at last.” And then the hard work of rooting out our systemic racism.  Joe Biden: ( 02:24:44 ) American history tells us that’s been in our darkest moments that we’ve made our greatest progress that we found the light. In this dark moment I believe we’re poised to make great progress again, and we can find the light once more.  Joe Biden: ( 02:25:07 ) Many people have heard me say this, but I’ve always believed you can define America in one word, possibilities. The defining future America, everything is possible. That in America, everyone, and I mean everyone should be given an opportunity to go as far as their dreams and God given ability will take them. We can never lose that.  Joe Biden: ( 02:25:32 ) In times as challenging as these, I believe there’s only one way forward as United America. A united America, United in our pursuit of a more perfect union, United in our dreams of a better future for us and for our children. United in our determination to make the coming years bright. Are you ready? I believe we are. This is a great nation. We’re a good and decent people. For Lord’s sake this is the United States of America, and there’s never been anything we’ve been able to accomplish what we’ve done it together.  Joe Biden: ( 02:26:17 ) The Irish poet Seamus Heaney once wrote, “History says don’t hope on this side of the grave, but then once in a lifetime the long for tidal wave of justice can rise up and hope and history rhyme.” This is our moment to make hope and history rhyme with passion and purpose. Let us begin you and I together. One nation under God, united in our love for American, united in our love for each other, for love is more powerful than hate. Hope is more powerful than fear, and right is more powerful and dark. This is our moment. This is our mission. May history be able to say that the end of this chapter of American darkness began here tonight, as love and hope and light join in the battle for the soul of the nation. And this is a battle we will win and we’ll do it together. I promise you. Thank you. And may God bless you. And may God protect our troops.  Joe Biden: ( 02:27:26 ) (singing)  Rabbi Lauren Berkun: ( 02:38:24 ) Good evening. I’m Rabbi Lauren Berkun. Please pray with me. God, you have been a refuge for us in every generation. As we conclude this convention from the safety of our homes, we pray for a national home, where security, dignity, and prosperity abound for all its inhabitants. Oh Lord, our guardian who neither slumbers nor sleeps, awaken us to the tireless task of perfecting our home in this great land built on foundations of freedom, justice and equality. Teach us to number our days that we may attain a heart of wisdom. Strengthen us each day in our sacred duty to promote leaders who will transform crisis into hope, challenge into opportunity, cruelty into compassion, and hate into love. So may it be your will and let us say, amen.  Jim Martin: ( 02:39:30 ) Hi, I’m father Jim Martin, let us pray. Loving God, help us open our hearts to those most in need. The unemployed parent worried about feeding his or her children, the woman who’s underpaid, harassed, or abused, the black man or woman who fears for their lives. The immigrant at the border longing for safety, the homeless person looking for a meal, the LGBT teen who’s bullied, the unborn child in the womb, the inmate on death row. Help us to be a nation where every life is sacred, all people are loved, and all are welcome. Amen.  Imam Al-Hajj Talib Abdur-Rashid: ( 02:40:15 ) Peace be on to you all, assalamu alaikum. I am Al-Hajj Talib Abdur-Rashid, imam of The Mosque of Islamic Brotherhood incorporated located in New York City. [foreign language 02:40:30] in the name our Lord, the merciful, the compassionate God. [foreign language 02:40:37], oh God of mankind, send us forth this night we pray, inspired with the courage to transform ourselves and our society. Grant us the unwavering resolve to exercise our demands of generational racism and violence from the soul of America once and for all. That our children’s children and their children might be spared the burden of our iniquities. Forgive us our sins of inhumanity to our neighbors, oh Lord. Bless our young and our elders, our teachers, and the common working people, our crisis responders, and our care takers.  Imam Al-Hajj Talib Abdur-Rashid: ( 02:41:38 ) Guide the leaders of this nation and bless them with reverence, moral courage, competence, integrity, empathy, love, and compassion. Hear our prayer most merciful God. Amen. Āmīn.  Speaker 39: ( 02:42:05 ) Four days ago we came together to begin a historic convention, a convention across America. Since then we’ve traveled all across this country, hearing from real people who are ready for something different, something better. We said this convention was for everyone and we really meant it. It will take all of us to solve the big challenges we are facing, but if we’ve seen anything these last four days is that Americans are up to the task.  Speaker 39: ( 02:42:36 ) So if you came here uncertain, I hope you’ll leave in resolved. And if you came here resolved I hope you’ll leave in fired up and ready to elect Joe Biden as our president and Kamala Harris as our vice president. And get out to vote for Democrats everywhere.  Speaker 39: ( 02:42:56 ) There being no further business to come before this convention I now declare the 48 Democratic National Convention to be adjourned, but I promise we the people are just getting started. Thank you Milwaukee. Thank you Wisconsin. And thank you America, and.  ( 02:43:15 ) good night.

Speaker 1: ( 00:53 ) Joe Biden picking up not one but three endorsements from his former opponents.  Speaker 2: ( 00:57 ) I will be casting my ballot for Joe Biden.  Speaker 3: ( 01:00 ) We have found that leader in Vice President soon to be President Joe Biden.  Speaker 4: ( 01:05 ) The Democrats really seemed to unify last night here in Dallas and do it behind Joe Biden.  Speaker 5: ( 01:10 ) It is up to us to heal this country. I am ending my campaign and endorsing Joe Biden for president.  Speaker 6: ( 01:18 ) The vice president gained the support of two more former rivals, Senators Kamala Harris and Cory Booker.  Kamala Harris: ( 01:25 ) He is a public servant. He has also worked for the best of who we are as a nation.  Kamala Harris: ( 01:31 ) We will elect Joe Biden as the next President of the United States.  Cory Booker: ( 01:34 ) I’m on Team Joe, I’m ridin’ with Biden.  Cory Booker: ( 01:37 ) I am so proud to be on Joe’s team because Joe is on your team.  Speaker 7: ( 01:43 ) I hereby am endorsing Joe Biden to be the next President of the United States.  Speaker 8: ( 01:48 ) Today I’m proud to join Joe Biden.  Julian Castro: ( 01:50 ) I don’t think there is anybody to try and heal the country right now than Joe Biden. People trust him. They believe in him.  Speaker 9: ( 01:57 ) Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders has officially endorsed.  Speaker 10: ( 02:00 ) Two men who represent these two wings of the Democratic Party coming together.  Bernie Sanders: ( 02:04 ) So today I am asking all Americans to come together in this campaign to support your candidacy which I endorse.  Speaker 11: ( 02:11 ) Former President Barack Obama now officially off the 2020 sidelines.  Barack Obama: ( 02:16 ) That’s why I’m so proud to endorse Joe Biden for President of the United States. Choosing Joe to be my vice president was one of the best decisions I ever made.  Speaker 12: ( 02:25 ) Biden picked up another major Democratic endorsement, this one from Elizabeth Warren.  Elizabeth Warren: ( 02:29 ) It’s up to all of us to help make Joe Biden the next President of the United States.  Speaker 13: ( 02:35 ) It’s all coming together for Joe Biden.  Speaker 3: ( 02:37 ) I’m doing everything that I can and thank you for being part of doing what you can.  Kamala Harris: ( 02:41 ) So join me in supporting Joe and let’s get this done.  Elizabeth Warren: ( 02:45 ) Let’s get to work. We’re all in this together.  Barack Obama: ( 02:48 ) Now is the time to fight for what we believe in. So join us.  Speaker 14: ( 03:00 ) The Democratic Party has always risen to our country’s greatest challenges.  Franklin Roosevelt: ( 03:05 ) I pledge myself to a New Deal for the American people.  Speaker 14: ( 03:11 ) We’ve moved this country forward in a relentless push for progress. Progress for Americans of all walks of life, not just the privileged few.  John Kennedy: ( 03:20 ) [inaudible 00:03:20] that we stand at this frontier at a turning point of history.  Speaker 15: ( 03:27 ) We do not want our freedom gradually, but we want to be free now.  Speaker 14: ( 03:32 ) We’ve brought together voices from every part of America.  Barbara Jordan: ( 03:35 ) We are a people in a quandary about the present. We are a people in search of our future. We are attempting to fulfill our national purpose to create and sustain a society in which all of us are equal.  Speaker 14: ( 03:54 ) And we’ve made history along the way.  Barack Obama: ( 03:57 ) There is not a liberal America and a conservative America, there is the United States of America.  Barack Obama: ( 04:05 ) We must pledge once more to march into the future.  Speaker 16: ( 04:09 ) We are a different society than we were in 1961. Brothers and sisters, do you want to go back? Or do you want to keep America moving forward?  Speaker 17: ( 04:23 ) For our motto is, “When they go low, we go high.”  Joe Biden: ( 04:30 ) We never bow, we never bend, we never break, no, we endure and we always, always, always move forward.  Speaker 14: ( 04:41 ) This election, we’ve engaged a historic number of Americans in the democratic process and now we have to overcome the odds once again to build back, better than before.  Joe Biden: ( 04:51 ) We lead not only by the example of our power, but by the power of our example. We are America, second to none, and we own the finish line. Don’t forget it.  Speaker 14: ( 05:05 ) We are Democrats and we’re ready to lead again. We’re coming together on August 17 all across America. Be there.  Speaker 18: ( 05:54 ) And now, live from Milwaukee, Mayor Tom Barrett.  Tom Barrett: ( 06:02 ) Hi everybody. I’m Tom Barrett, the proud mayor of Milwaukee. I would love to be welcoming you to my home city right now. The good people of Milwaukee and I were so excited when we learned that our resilient city was chosen to host the 2020 Democratic National Convention. It was the first time a major political party chose Wisconsin to hold its convention, but these are not conventional times and as a result, as we all know, this is not a conventional convention, and as much as we would have loved to host you in person, I am proud that the Democratic Party and the City of Milwaukee have made the health of our residents our number one priority. Unlike the president, we’ve never called COVID-19 a hoax, unlike the president, we’ve never made fun of face masks and unlike the president, we’ve never belittled our public health experts. We understand why we can’t be together this week and I hope you do to, and as our party comes together virtually to nominate Joe Biden to be our next president, we’re showing the country that we’re nominating a leader who isn’t afraid to make tough choices or to work with health experts, not against them, to address this pandemic.  Tom Barrett: ( 07:32 ) Milwaukee is a very special place on America’s Fresh Coast. I look forward to the day when you are all able to come experience our beautiful lakefront, our historic neighborhoods, and above all, our diverse, hardworking and friendly residents. But in the meantime, it is my honor to call the second session of the 48th Quadrennial National Convention of the Democratic Party to order.  Bennie Thompson: ( 08:08 ) Delegates, we will now hear reports from our three convention standing committees. To start us off, I’m pleased to introduce Lorraine Miller and James Roosevelt, Jr., co-chairs of the Credentials Committee to present their committee’s report.  Jim Roosevelt: ( 08:25 ) Hello delegates to the 2020 Democratic National Convention. My name is Jim Roosevelt and it is an honor to have served as a co-chair of the Credentials Committee along with my good friend Lorraine Miller. Pursuant to the convention rules, the Credentials Committee met and took action to approve the credentials of the delegates and alternates that have been credentialed for the 2020 Democratic National Convention. I am proud to say that all credentials issues were resolved in accordance with the actions of the Credentials Committee. This year’s nominating process reflects the efforts of so many to make our process more open and more transparent. As a result, we know that our delegates reflect the best of our party and we are all united around our nominees, Joe Biden and Kamala Harris.  Lorraine Miller: ( 09:14 ) May I add my thanks for the opportunity to serve as a co-chair of the Credentials Committee with my friend Jim Roosevelt. Our state and territorial parties have worked diligently in these unprecedented times to make sure that their delegations reflect the great diversity of our party. We are proud that our party places a priority on making sure that participants of this convention highlight a core value of our party, that is ensuring that all Americans, regardless of sex, race, age, color, creed, national origin, religion, economic status, sexual orientation, gender identity, ethnic identity, or physical disability have a role in this important process. Mr. Chair, I am pleased to report that the Credentials Committee report was approved by committee members and all delegates have been fully credentialed.  Bennie Thompson: ( 10:30 ) Thank you Lorraine and Jim. We will now hear from the co-chairs of the Rules Committee, Maria Cardona and Congressman Barney Frank to present that committee’s report.  Maria Cardona: ( 10:41 ) [Spanish 00:10:41]. My name is Maria Cardona and I am so honored to serve as co-chair of the Rules and Bylaws Committee of the Democratic National Convention along with my friend and colleague Congressman Barney Frank. The Rules Committee met the last week of July to adopt the convention rules of procedure, officers, and agenda. The committee approved the rules that will govern the convention. These rules are based on a longstanding process that has governed our conventions for many, many cycles. Given the unprecedented nature of the COVID-19 health crisis, these rules that were approved focus on providing for a convention that will transform the convention experience for delegates and for participants and will allow for maximum participation by those delegates.  Maria Cardona: ( 11:35 ) The Rules Committee also ratified a dynamic group of Democrats to serve as the officers of the convention. The convention officers truly represent the ideals and the principles of the Democratic Party. These actions of the Rules Committee will ensure that the 2020 Democratic National Convention can efficiently and effectively proceed with its important business. The Rules Committee also took action on a resolution that was recommended for approval by convention delegates. The resolution calls on the Democratic National Committee to continue the work from this cycle to improve our nominating process and to build on those reforms for the 2024 cycle. The resolution calls on the DNC Rules Committee to conduct a comprehensive review of the presidential nominating reforms that were made and to evaluate where even further reforms might by needed. This review and accounting will be complete by March 31, 2021. Chair, I am pleased to report that the unity resolution was approved by the delegates. Thank you to the delegates, thank you to the members of the Rules and Bylaws Committee, and thank you for continuing to do everything you can to ensure we are successful in November. [Spanish 00:13:01].  Barney Frank: ( 13:02 ) Two things about the rules are very important to note. One, they continue and build on the trend towards making our nominating process as democratic as possible with a small d. We have asked that we go to primaries rather than caucuses, we have restricted and maintained those restrictions on unelected delegates. Secondly it’s important to note that everything in these rules is the product of a very free agreement between the Sanders and Biden people as it was last time between Clinton and Sanders, that is we have a very democratic set of rules agreed upon enthusiastically by both camps.  Bennie Thompson: ( 13:44 ) Thank you Maria and Barney. It’s my pleasure to call on Platform Committee co-chairs Julie Chavez Rodriguez and Denis McDonough to present their committee’s report.  Julie Chavez Rodriguez: ( 13:56 ) Good evening. I’m Julie Chavez Rodriguez, and alongside my friend Denis McDonough, I was honored to co-chair this year’s Democratic Platform Committee. This spring, the process for drafting our 2020 Democratic platform began with the formation of the unity task forces. Appointed by Vice President Biden and Senator Sanders, the task forces focused their work on six major policy priorities. Continuing the work of the task forces, the Platform Drafting Committee engaged voters and encouraged them to share their stories so that their values were reflected. The Platform Drafting Committee chaired by Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms engaged so many throughout our party to ensure that that feedback was incorporated, whether it was received online or through allied groups.  Denis McDonough: ( 14:54 ) Thanks Julie. I’m Denis McDonough and I’m proud to have been Julie’s co-chair on the Platform Committee. Our committee has produced a platform that proposes solutions to the challenges that American families face in this unprecedented time. It’s informed by the values of our party and the priorities of our presidential nominee, Vice President Joe Biden. I strongly believe that this platform lays out an agenda, informed by the values that will defeat Donald Trump and heal the soul of our nation, the United States of America.  Bennie Thompson: ( 15:29 ) Thank you Julie and Denis. Thank you to all the members of all three standing committees for your important work to ensure we have a smooth and orderly convention, a platform that represents our party’s values and interests, and a plan for continuing to look at how we conduct our affairs in the best spirit of openness, fairness and inclusion.  Daniel Inouye: ( 16:14 ) My fellow Americans, this is my country. Many of us have fought hard for the right to say that. Many are now struggling today from Harlem to Danang so that they may say this with conviction, this is our country.  Barbara Jordan: ( 16:42 ) We are a people in a quandary about the president. We are a people in search of our future.  Mario Cuomo: ( 16:52 ) We must make the American people hear our tale of two cities. We must convince them that we don’t have to settle for two cities, that we can have one city, indivisible, shining for all of its people.  Ann Richards: ( 17:11 ) If you give us a chance, we can perform. After all, Ginger Rogers did everything that Fred Astaire did. She just did it backwards and in high heels.  Barack Obama: ( 17:31 ) There is not a liberal America and a conservative America, there is the United States of America. There is not a black America and a white America and Latino America and Asian America. There is the United States of America.  Julian Castro: ( 17:50 ) The American dream is not a sprint or even a marathon, but a relay. Our families don’t always cross the finish line in the span of one generation, but each generation passes onto the next the fruits of their labor.  Barack Obama: ( 18:06 ) We are one people, all of us pledging allegiance to the stars and stripes. All of us defending the United States of America.  Nikki Fried: ( 18:09 ) Welcome.  Malcolm Kenyatta: ( 18:09 ) Welcome.  Sam Park: ( 18:09 ) Welcome.  Victoria Neave and Brendan Boyle: ( 18:09 ) To the second night –  N. Fried, S. Park, M. Kenyatta, R. Akbari …: ( 18:09 ) Of the Democratic National Convention.  Denny Ruprecht: ( 18:09 ) This is a different kind of convention.  Marlon Kimpson: ( 18:09 ) Look at the camera and smile.  Mari Manoogian: ( 18:28 ) And this –  Conor Lamb: ( 18:28 ) This is a different kind of keynote.  Mari Manoogian: ( 18:29 ) It’s a different kind of keynote.  Y. Cancela, V. Neave, R. Woodfin, C. Lamb: ( 18:31 ) This year –  Y. Cancela, B. Boyle, M. Manoogian …: ( 18:32 ) All of us are on stage –  K. Clyde, R. Garcia, R. Woodfin, R. Akbari …: ( 18:33 ) And we’ve got a lot to say.  Jonathan Nez: ( 18:36 ) Let’s get real. There’s a lot riding on this election.  Robert Garcia: ( 18:39 ) When we’re facing the biggest economic and health crisis in generations because our president didn’t and still doesn’t have a plan.  Malcolm Kenyatta: ( 18:47 ) When doctors, nurses and home healthcare aides in Philadelphia have to risk their own lives to protect others because there’s not enough protective equipment.  Kathleen Clyde: ( 18:57 ) When factory workers in Ohio are faced with dangerous conditions because this administration hasn’t given clear guidance on how to protect our people.  Sam Park: ( 19:06 ) When teachers in Gwinnett County, Georgia and across the country are being asked to return to the classroom without a plan to keep them safe and parents are exhausted juggling full-time work and full-time childcare.  Jonathan Nez: ( 19:19 ) And visiting our parents and grandparents through the window of a nursing home, worrying all the time that they’ll get sick.  Marlon Kimpson: ( 19:27 ) When unemployment in North Charleston, South Carolina, a city I represent, has risen nearly fourfold and evictions are putting families out on the street in the middle of a pandemic.  Nikki Fried: ( 19:41 ) Make no mistake, it didn’t have to be this bad. In the early days of the virus, Donald Trump didn’t listen to the experts, and then he said something that a president should never say.  Victoria Neave: ( 19:52 ) He said, “I don’t take responsibility at all.”  Speaker 19: ( 19:56 ) No responsibility.  Speaker 20: ( 19:57 ) No leadership.  Speaker 21: ( 19:58 ) no plan.  Speaker 22: ( 19:59 ) He still doesn’t have a plan.  Yvanna Cancela: ( 20:01 ) Donald Trump just doesn’t understand. We can’t fix our economy until we get ahold of the virus.  Conor Lamb: ( 20:08 ) While working families are struggling, he’s looking out for the people who are already doing just fine. The wealthy, the big corporations, the donors to his campaign.  Jonathan Nez: ( 20:18 ) He’s looking out for himself.  Randall Woodfin: ( 20:20 ) If there is one person who is looking out for us –  Speaker 23: ( 20:23 ) All of us.  Malcolm Kenyatta: ( 20:24 ) And that’s Joe Biden.  Nikki Fried: ( 20:25 ) Joe called it. We are in a battle for the soul of our nation.  Mari Manoogian: ( 20:30 ) But Joe knows we can never let hard times turn us against each other.  Conor Lamb: ( 20:34 ) And we can never stop doing the hard work to make things right.  Speaker 24: ( 20:38 ) That’s why we ran for office.  Speaker 25: ( 20:41 ) Even when people counted us out.  Yvanna Cancela: ( 20:43 ) Even when there had never been a Latina in the Nevada State Senate.  Nikki Fried: ( 20:48 ) Or a Democrat elected as Florida Commissioner of Agriculture in nearly three decades.  Sam Park: ( 20:53 ) Or an openly gay man in the Georgia state legislature.  Randall Woodfin: ( 20:57 ) When Birmingham hadn’t had a mayor this young in 120 years.  Denny Ruprecht: ( 21:01 ) We ran for office because we know the struggles American families are facing. Because we’ve lived them.  Malcolm Kenyatta: ( 21:08 ) We’ve lived the insecurity and the indignity of an eviction notice.  Robert Garcia: ( 21:14 ) I like many of you have lived the frustration of paying off student loans.  Randall Woodfin: ( 21:19 ) We have lived the grief of losing loved ones to gun violence and the criminal justice system that unfairly targets our communities.  Sam Park: ( 21:28 ) We have lived that feeling of helplessness when someone you love is very sick and access to healthcare is a matter of life and death.  Colin Allred: ( 21:36 ) By the way, Joe Biden has lived a lot of this too.  B. Boyle, C. Allred, M. Kenyatta, M. Kimpson …: ( 21:40 ) He was raised in a middle class family in Scranton, Pennsylvania and Claymont, Delaware.  Speaker 26: ( 21:45 ) He watched his dad look for work and learned that a job is about so much more than a paycheck. It’s about dignity and respect.  Speaker 27: ( 21:55 ) He was sworn into office from the hospital room of his two young sons after a car crash killed his wife and infant daughter.  Nikki Fried: ( 22:05 ) He knows what it’s like to thank God you have healthcare.  Brendan Boyle: ( 22:09 ) He knows what it’s like to work hard for everything you’ve got.  Conor Lamb: ( 22:13 ) He knows what it’s like to send a child off to war.  Victoria Neave: ( 22:16 ) And he’ll never forget who he’s fighting for.  Colin Allred: ( 22:21 ) I look around my district in North Texas and I see the people who built this country. The educators, like the single mom who raised me, the men and women on the frontlines of our healthcare system. You built this country.  Mari Manoogian: ( 22:33 ) Small business owners like the ones whose shops and restaurants line the streets of Birmingham, Michigan.  Marlon Kimpson: ( 22:39 ) Charleston, South Carolina.  Jonathan Nez: ( 22:40 ) Of tribal nations.  Malcolm Kenyatta: ( 22:41 ) Line the streets of Philadelphia and bring our communities to life. You built this country.  Raumesh Akbari: ( 22:48 ) The nurses in Memphis who came out of retirement to treat patients during this pandemic. You built this country.  Robert Garcia: ( 22:56 ) And you know what? You deserve more than the constant chaos that Donald Trump delivers.  Brendan Boyle: ( 23:02 ) You deserve healthcare you can afford, a job that pays you fairly. You deserve child care and paid sick leave while you work and when you pay into Social Security and Medicare, you deserve to know it will be there when you retire.  S. Park, D. Ruprecht, R. Akbari, R. Woodfin: ( 23:17 ) And that’s why we ran.  Jonathan Nez: ( 23:18 ) Thanks to the voters across the country in both red states and blue states –  N. Fried, M. Kimpson, J. Nez, R. Garcia: ( 23:21 ) We won.  Malcolm Kenyatta: ( 23:23 ) A new generation of leaders is rising up.  Conor Lamb: ( 23:26 ) And with Joe Biden in the White House, there is no limit to what we can do.  Yvanna Cancela: ( 23:31 ) In Nevada, we’re making drug prices more transparent so people with chronic illnesses won’t go broke while drug companies get rich.  Colin Allred: ( 23:41 ) Joe’s working to protect and expand the Affordable Care Act to make sure millions of people keep their coverage and no one can be denied for a pre-existing condition. To bring down the costs of healthcare and prescription drugs too, giving tax credits to working families and allowing Medicare to negotiate drug prices.  Mari Manoogian: ( 23:59 ) That’s a big effing deal.  M. Kenyatta, V. Neave, M. Kimpson, R. Woodfin: ( 24:00 ) That’s a big effing deal.  Kathleen Clyde: ( 24:03 ) Because Joe knows we can’t have a healthy economy if people can’t afford healthcare.  Brendan Boyle: ( 24:09 ) Let’s remember, Donald Trump is suing to take healthcare coverage away from more than 20 million Americans and eliminate protections for over 100 million with pre-existing conditions –  S. Park, Y. Cancela, M. Manoogian, C. Lamb: ( 24:22 ) In thee middle of a pandemic.  Victoria Neave: ( 24:24 ) In Texas, we’re standing up for fierce women like my mom and my [inaudible 00:24:29] who raised me to never back down from a tough fight. So we’re fighting to make sure that mothers have access to health screenings for safe pregnancies and childbirth and we’re bringing long overdue justice to survivors of sexual assault.  Raumesh Akbari: ( 24:46 ) Joe Biden has been fighting for women his entire career. As senator, he authored the Violence Against Women Act, and as president, he’ll restore funding for Planned Parenthood, he will codify Roe v. Wade, and make reducing maternal mortality especially for women of color a top priority.  Nikki Fried: ( 25:03 ) In Florida, on the frontlines of our climate crisis, we’re working to produce more renewable energy and shrink our carbon footprint.  Jonathan Nez: ( 25:12 ) Joe has a major plan to invest in clean energy jobs and infrastructure.  Brendan Boyle: ( 25:17 ) In the House of Representatives, we’re closing loopholes to ensure local infrastructure projects use American-made materials and local labor and support American manufacturing.  Yvanna Cancela: ( 25:28 ) Unlike Donald Trump, Joe Biden will actually enforce buy American rules, investing in American-made clean energy, building materials, high tech equipment and R&D, all creating more good jobs.  Mari Manoogian: ( 25:43 ) In Michigan, we’re banning business practices that have exploited workers and cost them hundreds of millions of dollars in lost wages.  Marlon Kimpson: ( 25:50 ) When unemployment is the highest rate since the Great Depression, when millions of people have seen their hours and pay slashed, Joe knows it’s not enough to rebuild the economy the way it was before. We’ve got to build it back better.  Brendan Boyle: ( 26:07 ) He’ll build an economy that rewards work, not wealth, and get rid of the Trump tax cuts that only benefit big corporations and the rich, and then he’ll invest in healthcare, education and infrastructure, and in getting small businesses up and running again.  Conor Lamb: ( 26:25 ) Take it from me, when you’re in the trenches, you want Joe Biden right there next to you.  Malcolm Kenyatta: ( 26:30 ) When I wanted to marry the man I loved, Joe Biden was the first national figure to support me and my family.  Matthew Miller: ( 26:37 ) Appreciate you man.  Mari Manoogian: ( 26:38 ) When the auto industry was going under, Joe stuck his neck out to protect it and helped save one and a half million auto jobs.  Conor Lamb: ( 26:46 ) When our economy was on the brink, Joe led the recovery effort that created millions of jobs, including here in Western Pennsylvania. Under his leadership, America bounced back with the longest economic expansion in history.  Nikki Fried: ( 26:59 ) You know, the one Trump brags about creating –  Colin Allred: ( 27:01 ) That’s what happens when Joe Biden is in your corner. Working families get a fair shot.  Mari Manoogian: ( 27:06 ) He understands that leadership means fighting for the people who built this country. All of you.  B. Boyle, C. Allred, M. Kenyatta, M. Kimpson …: ( 27:12 ) All of us.  Stacey Abrams: ( 27:14 ) This nation belongs to all of us and in every election, we choose how we will create a more perfect union. Not by taking sides, but by taking stock of where we are and what we need. This year’s choice could not be more clear. America faces a triple threat, a public health catastrophe, an economic collapse, and a reckoning with racial justice and inequality. So our choice is clear. A steady, experienced public servant who can lead us out of this crisis just like he’s done before, or a man who only knows how to deny and distract. A leader who cares about our families or a president who only cares about himself. We know Joe Biden. America, we need Joe Biden. To make your voice heard, text VOTE to 30330.  Stacey Abrams: ( 28:12 ) In a democracy, we do not elect saviors. We cast our ballots for those who see our struggles and pledge to serve, who hear our dreams and work to make them real. Who defend our way of life by protecting our right to vote. Faced with a president of cowardice, Joe Biden is a man of proven courage. He will restore our moral compass by confronting our challenges, not by hiding from them or undermining our elections to keep his job. In a time of voter suppression at home and authoritarians abroad, Joe Biden will be a champion for free and fair elections, for a public health system that keeps us safe, for an economy that we build back better than before and for accountability and integrity in our system of justice. We stand with Joe Biden because this isn’t just about defeating Donald Trump. We are in this to win for America, so let’s get it done.  Tracee Ellis Ross: ( 29:23 ) Hello. I’m Tracee Ellis Ross and how exciting to hear from young elected leaders from across the country. A perfect way to begin Night Two of the Democratic National Convention, uniting America. Tonight is all about leadership. This unprecedented moment calls for leadership, steady, inclusive leadership, driven by people who understand that our democracy is based on the value of each and every one of us being treated with dignity and respect. Leaders who respond to the needs of hardworking Americans who right this minute are unable to pay rent, put food on the table and keep their loved ones safe. As a black woman, I find myself at a crucial intersection in American politics. For far too long, black female leadership in this country has been utilized without being acknowledged or valued, but we are turning the tide. Hello Kamala. Her nomination is historic for anyone who believes in we the people. Like Senator Harris and many we saw in the keynote, today’s leaders emerge from communities that have long been under-represented. They are charting new paths in the spirit of Shirley Chisholm, Charlotta Bass, Fannie Lou Hamer, and John Lewis. They get in good trouble, necessary trouble. They call things out otherwise ignored, elevating our nation –  Tracee Ellis Ross: ( 31:03 ) … things out otherwise ignored, elevating our nation and changing the course of our lives for the better. With every vote we cast for forward-thinking, honest leaders, we chip away at ingrained systems of inequity and we bend the arc of justice.  Tracee Ellis Ross: ( 31:20 ) True leaders make sure that policy is informed by all of us, bridging our burden past to a safe, equitable, and even joyful future. Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are that bridge, heeding voices from within the movement for racial justice, listening to the people, and acting with empathy and compassion to reflect our shared humanity.  Tracee Ellis Ross: ( 31:49 ) Tonight, we’ll hear from a number of American leaders, including former acting US Attorney General, Sally Yates, who refused to defend an unconstitutional travel ban and paid for it with her job.  Joe Biden: ( 32:01 ) A threat to this nation, to our democracy is real. It’s clear and it’s present. We’ve watched the president now for three years. Look at what he’s doing, instilling fear. I mean, not joking. Instilling fear. Showing division, stroking racial division, undercutting every institution that was designed to check the abuse of power by the president or anyone else. All this for what reason? All this in order to solidify his base and expand his power.  Sally Yates: ( 32:45 ) Good evening. I’m Sally Yates. Speaking at a political convention is something I never expected to be doing, but the future of our democracy is at stake. I’m here in my hometown of Atlanta, where as a young lawyer, I joined our nation’s justice department. For nearly 30 years through Democratic and Republican administrations, I worked alongside my DOJ colleagues to advance our nation’s promise of equal justice.  Sally Yates: ( 33:15 ) I served as deputy attorney general in the Obama-Biden administration, and stayed on as acting attorney general for the Trump transition. Then 10 days in, I was fired for refusing to defend President Trump’s shameful and unlawful Muslim travel ban. That was the start of his relentless attacks on our democratic institutions and countless dedicated public servants.  Sally Yates: ( 33:42 ) Like me, these officials didn’t swear an oath to a person or a party. Public servants promise to defend our Constitution, uphold our laws, and work on behalf of the American people. But from the moment President Trump took office, he’s used his position to benefit himself rather than our country. He’s trampled the rule of law, trying to weaponize our justice department to attack his enemies and protect his friends. Rather than standing up to Vladimir Putin, he fawns over a dictator who is still trying to interfere in our elections. He’s even trying to sabotage our postal service to keep people from being able to vote.  Sally Yates: ( 34:32 ) His constant attacks on the FBI, the free press, inspectors general, federal judges, they all have one purpose, to remove any check on his abuse of power. Put simply, he treats our country like it’s his family business. This time, bankrupting our nation’s moral authority at home and abroad.  Sally Yates: ( 34:58 ) But our country doesn’t belong to him. It belongs to all of us. Joe Biden embraces that. He has spent his entire life putting our country first. He has never backed down from a challenge or a bully. He summons the best in us, and lives by the values that define us as Americans, service, integrity, courage, compassion.  Sally Yates: ( 35:29 ) There are countless stories of Joe Biden reaching out to someone in their moment of need. Well, this is our country’s moment of need. We need a president who respects our laws and the privilege of public service. Who reflects our values and cares about our people. We need a president who will restore the soul of America. We need Joe Biden.  Sally Yates: ( 35:55 ) (singing)  Tony A.: ( 36:02 ) Over the last four years, we have experienced failed leadership under Donald J. Trump.  Chris F.: ( 36:06 ) We’ve had to deal with his insanity.  Donna-Marie W.: ( 36:09 ) I’ve watched our country deteriorate.  Micah: ( 36:11 ) The coverups, the lying, the favoritism.  Nancy G.: ( 36:15 ) The disregard for the Constitution.  Joseph W.: ( 36:17 ) Donald Trump has failed America.  Tony A.: ( 36:20 ) It is time for us to reclaim our constitutional and democratic value.  Denise: ( 36:24 ) We need to prove to the world, and most importantly, prove to ourselves that we are better than this.  Nick: ( 36:31 ) We need an experienced leader.  Tony A.: ( 36:31 ) A leader that has passion, integrity, and strategic leadership skills.  Chris F.: ( 36:36 ) His name is Joe Biden.  Joseph W.: ( 36:37 ) Joe Biden.  Nick: ( 36:38 ) Joe Biden is that leader.  Donna-Marie W.: ( 36:39 ) And he really wants the best for this country.  Georgia M.: ( 36:42 ) He understands and respects our democracy, the rule of law, and the US Constitution.  Jacqueline A.: ( 36:47 ) He will move toward creating a more perfect union.  Jacqueline A.: ( 36:55 ) (singing)  Cameraman: ( 36:55 ) Two, one.  Chuck Schumer: ( 37:01 ) Hi.  Cameraman: ( 37:01 ) Go.  Chuck Schumer: ( 37:02 ) Hi, this is Senator Chuck Schumer, Democratic leader, from my hometown, Brooklyn, New York. Behind me is a site I see out of my window every night, the Statue of Liberty. The same site that greeted hopeful immigrants, like my grandparents. A symbol of freedom and a beacon of hope to the world.  Chuck Schumer: ( 37:25 ) Today, Donald Trump has divided our country, diminished our greatness, and demeaned everything that this statue represents. He even hid in a bunker as Americans were teargassed and beaten. Millions are jobless, 170,000 Americans have died from COVID, and Donald Trump says, “It is what it is.”  Chuck Schumer: ( 37:46 ) A president should never say, “It is what it is.” President Lincoln, honoring the great sacrifice at Gettysburg, didn’t say, “It is what it is.” President Roosevelt seeing a third of the nation ill-housed, ill-clad, and ill-nourished didn’t say, “It is what it is.”  Chuck Schumer: ( 38:02 ) America, Donald Trump has quit on you. We need a president with dignity, integrity, and the experience to lead us out of this crisis. A man with a steady hand and a big heart who will never, ever quit on America. That man is my friend, Joe Biden.  Chuck Schumer: ( 38:23 ) He will be a great president. But if we’re going to win this battle for the soul of our nation, Joe can’t do it alone. Democrats must take back the Senate. We will stay united from Sanders and Warren to Manchin and Warner. And with our unity, we will bring bold and dramatic change to our country.  Chuck Schumer: ( 38:44 ) Let me tell you some of the things we’d do. With President Biden, Vice President Harris, and a Democratic majority, we will make healthcare affordable for all. We’ll undo the vicious inequality of income and wealth that has plagued America for far too long, and we’ll take strong, decisive action to combat climate change and save the planet. We will protect voting rights, fight systemic racism in the criminal justice system and in our economy, and restore a Supreme Court that looks out for people, not corporations. We’ll rebuild our infrastructure and make sure every home, from inner city to rural America, has broadband. We will save the post office. And once and for all, defeat COVID-19, this evil disease.  Chuck Schumer: ( 39:35 ) And beckoned by the lady behind us, we will reform our immigration system so that immigrants yearning to breathe free, will at last become American citizens. Together, we can reignite the hope once felt by millions of men and women, huddled masses on creaking ships, who glimpsed this mighty woman with her torch, knowing they could build a better life here in America. And out of this long, national nightmare, America will finally awaken to a brighter future and a new day.  Tracee Ellis Ross: ( 40:18 ) Senator Chuck Schumer reminding us that leadership requires integrity and accountability. Real leaders don’t ask what we can do for them, they ask what they can do for us. In a minute, we will hear from two former presidents, and they are going to speak to that. But first, here are Caroline Kennedy and her son, Jack Schlossberg.  Caroline Kennedy: ( 40:40 ) Sixty years ago in a crowded LA stadium, my father accepted the Democratic nomination for president. He challenged Americans to look to the future and join him on a journey toward a new frontier.  Jack Schlossberg: ( 40:53 ) It was a call to the young at heart, regardless of age or party. Times have changed, but the themes of my grandfather’s speech, courage, unity, and patriotism, are as important today as they were in 1960. And once again, we need a leader who believes America’s best days are yet to come. We need Joe Biden.  Caroline Kennedy: ( 41:13 ) I’ve admired Joe Biden since I was a Senate intern in 1974. He shared my Uncle Teddy’s commitment to civil rights, women’s rights, and working families. He was a senator who cared, who led, who inspired. That’s why I helped choose him to be Barack Obama’s running mate in 2008.  Caroline Kennedy: ( 41:33 ) When I was US ambassador to Japan, I got to see Vice President Biden in action. He stepped off Air Force Two wearing his aviator glasses and a big smile, radiating American optimism and generosity. I saw a leader who was tough but fair, who commanded the trust and respect of other nations, and who always put America’s interests first. Joe Biden’s lifetime of public service reflects his unwavering commitment to our highest ideals.  Jack Schlossberg: ( 42:04 ) In this election, our future is on the ballot. For my generation, it will define the rest of our lives. We need to tackle climate change, we need to end systemic racial injustice, we need to make healthcare available for everybody, and we need to rebuild an economy that helps working families.  Jack Schlossberg: ( 42:21 ) We can do this. We can reach these new frontiers, but only with a president who asks what he can do for our country and what together we can do to build a better world. It’s up to us. Let’s get it done. Let’s elect Joe Biden the next president of the United States.  Caroline Kennedy: ( 42:35 ) Let’s elect Joe Biden the next president of the United States.  Rosalynn Carter: ( 42:38 ) It’s a great pleasure for Jimmy and me to join you in celebrating our next president of the United States, Joe Biden. We’ve known and admired Joe and Jill for many years. Most recently, I’ve worked with him on tackling the demands faced by the more than 53 million unpaid caregivers in our country who are juggling work and other family responsibilities, and putting their own physical, and mental health, and well-being at risk.  Rosalynn Carter: ( 43:10 ) Joe knows well, too well, the sorrows and struggles of being a family caregiver. From Joe’s time as a young widower thrust into single parenthood with a demanding job, to he and Jill caring for their own parents and their son Beau at the end of their lives, he knows caregiving is hard, even on the good days. Joe and I also know the challenges of caregiving for those who served in the military and returned with visible and invisible wounds. And we know those caregivers need a leader in the White House. Jimmy and I are voting for Joe because he recognizes the challenges facing our families, and has the heart and the talent to make life better for all Americans.  Jimmy Carter: ( 43:54 ) When I ran for president in 1976, Joe Biden was my first and most effective supporter in the Senate. For decades, he has been my loyal and dedicated friend. Joe has the experience, character, and decency to bring us together and restore America’s greatness. We deserve a person with integrity and judgment, someone who is honest and fair, someone who is committed to what is best for the American people.  Jimmy Carter: ( 44:26 ) Joe is that kind of leader, and he is the right person for this moment in our nation’s history. He understands that honesty and dignity are essential traits that determine not only our vision, but our actions. More than ever, that’s what we need.  Jimmy Carter: ( 44:42 ) During these uncertain times, Joe Biden realizes that many American lives can be saved each day with the use of masks and testing, as recommended by our medical experts. Joe Biden must be our next president.  Bill Clinton: ( 45:00 ) Good evening. A presidential election is the world’s most important job interview. At the end, we hire a leader to help us solve problems,, create opportunities and give our kids better tomorrows. That’s a tall order this year, with the COVID-19 outbreak on a path to killing 200,000 people and destroying millions of jobs and small businesses.  Bill Clinton: ( 45:21 ) How did Donald Trump respond? At first, he said the virus was under control and would soon disappear. When it didn’t, he was on TV every day bragging on what a great job he was doing, while our scientists waited to give us vital information. When he didn’t like the expert advice he was given, he ignored it.  Bill Clinton: ( 45:42 ) Only when COVID exploded in even more states did he encourage people to wear masks. By then, many more were dying. When asked about the surge in deaths, he shrugged and said, “It is what it is.”  Bill Clinton: ( 45:55 ) But did it have to be this way? No. COVID hit us much harder than it had to. We have just 4% of the world’s population, but 25% of the world’s COVID cases. Our unemployment rate is more than twice as high as South Korea’s, 2.5 times the United Kingdom’s, more than three times Japan’s. Donald Trump says we’re leading the world. Well, we are the only major industrial economy to have its unemployment rate tripled.  Bill Clinton: ( 46:24 ) At a time like this, the Oval Office should be a command center. Instead, it’s a storm center. There’s only chaos. Just one thing never changes, his determination to deny responsibility and shift the blame. The buck never stops there.  Bill Clinton: ( 46:42 ) Now you have to decide whether to renew his contract or hire someone else. If you want a president who defines the job as spending hours a day watching TV and zapping people on social media, he’s your man. Denying, distracting, and demeaning works great if you’re trying to entertain or inflame. But in a real crisis, it collapses like a house of cards.  Bill Clinton: ( 47:06 ) COVID just doesn’t respond to any of that. To beat it, you’ve got to actually go to work and deal with the facts.  Bill Clinton: ( 47:13 ) Our party is united in offering you a very different choice, a go-to-work president. A down-to-earth, get-the-job-done guy. A man with a mission to take responsibility, not shift the blame; concentrate, not distract; unite, not divide. Our choice is Joe Biden.  Bill Clinton: ( 47:32 ) Joe helped bring us back from a recession before, and he can do it again. In 2009, Barack Obama and Joe Biden started with the worst economy since the Great Depression. When they were done, they delivered more than six straight years of job growth.  Bill Clinton: ( 47:48 ) What did Joe do? He accepted responsibility for implementing the Recovery Act. His work created a lot of new jobs and started many new companies in communities across our country. Now Joe is committed to building America back again.  Bill Clinton: ( 48:03 ) How? He’s given us smart, detailed plans to invest in areas vital to our future. Innovative financing for modern factories and small businesses, good jobs in green energy and conservation to combat climate change, a modern infrastructure that brings small town and rural America the connectivity and investment others take for granted, and a plan to ensure that Black Americans, Latino Americans, Native Americans, women, immigrants, and other communities left behind are full participants in our economy and our society.  Bill Clinton: ( 48:37 ) Joe Biden wants to build an economy far better suited to our changing world. Better for young people. Better for families working and raising their kids. Better for people who lost jobs and need new ones. Better for farmers tired of being collateral damage in trade wars. Better for workers caring for the sick, elderly, and people with disabilities. Better because of a living wage and access to affordable higher education and healthcare, including prescription drugs, and to childcare, a secure retirement, and for the first time, paid family and medical leave.  Bill Clinton: ( 49:13 ) Joe won’t just put a signature on a check and try to fool you into thinking it came from him. He’ll work to make sure that your paycheck reflects your contribution to and your stake in a growing economy.  Bill Clinton: ( 49:26 ) In this job interview, the difference is stark. You know what Donald Trump will do with four more years, blame, bully, and belittle. And you know what Joe Biden will do, build back better. It’s Trump’s “us vs. them” America against Joe Biden’s America, where we all live and work together. It’s a clear choice. The future of our country is riding on it. Thank you.  Tracee Ellis Ross: ( 49:54 ) It’s time to call the roll and officially nominate the Democratic candidate for president of the United States. But this year for the first time, the roll call is heading out to all 57 states and territories. Places that showcase our nation’s natural beauty, places where people are working together to secure a better future for our country, and places that are working to rebuild and recover. Like Iowa, where thousands have been left homeless and hundreds of thousands have been left without power in the wake of last week’s terrible storm. Our hearts are with you, Iowa.  Tracee Ellis Ross: ( 50:34 ) There’s so much going on right now. Tonight, we come together to nominate a candidate who will fight for all of us. The convention delegates will do the official nominating, but you can join them in supporting Joe Biden. Text “join” to 30330 to get involved. Now, the chair of the Democratic National Committee, Tom Perez.  Tom Perez: ( 51:02 ) It’s great to be here in Milwaukee, a proud union town whose has grit and character reflect the resilience of our party and our country. There’s no doubt these last few months have been tough, but good leadership means being able to adapt to any situation. I want to thank the people of Milwaukee for being such gracious and flexible hosts.  Tom Perez: ( 51:23 ) It’s also great to be back in Wisconsin, where I was lucky enough to marry my wife Ann Marie a little more than three decades ago. The progressive movement has deep roots here. Since today is the 100th anniversary of the 19th Amendment’s ratification, we should point out that Wisconsin was the first state to ratify it.  Tom Perez: ( 51:41 ) What’s more, in its one word motto, “Forward,” Wisconsin captures something so important about America. The way that no matter what challenges today brings, we always believe a better future is possible.  Tom Perez: ( 51:58 ) That’s what my parents believed when they immigrated to this country nearly a century ago, fleeing the iron fist of a brutal dictator in the Dominican Republic. This nation welcomed them with compassion. They quickly learned that their hope of building a better life through hard work was shared by generations of Americans.  Tom Perez: ( 52:18 ) Indeed, every American story is a story about that hope, that sense of possibility. It’s what unites us, defines us, and it’s what sustains us now. We will work to meet our extraordinary challenges, because progress is made by the hopeful, not the cynical. We will do that work together because movements are built by the many, not the few.  Tom Perez: ( 52:43 ) As you watch tonight’s decidedly unconventional roll call and reflect on the diversity of our nation, remember you too are part of the American story. No matter where you come from or where you’re watching from tonight, you have a place in Joe Biden’s Democratic Party.  Bennie Thompson: ( 53:07 ) Delegates and distinguished guests, under our procedural rules, two Democratic candidates submitted nominating documents to our convention secretary for the office of president of the United States, Senator Bernie Sanders and Vice President Joe Biden. As such, each candidate has provided names of individuals who will make nominating and seconding speeches on their behalf. We will begin with nominating and seconding speeches for Senator Sanders. Speaking on his behalf will be two progressive champions, Bob King and Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.  Bob King: ( 53:51 ) I’m Bob King. As a proud union member and former president of a great American union, the UAW, I am honored to nominate Bernie Sanders for president. For decades, Bernie has led the fight for working families, fighting for workers’ rights to organize unions and collectively bargain. In a time of enormous inequality, he understands that we must confront large corporations, which have far too much control over our economy and our politics.  Bob King: ( 54:18 ) Bernie believes healthcare is a human right, and should not be contingent on a job. He knows we can rebuild our crumbling infrastructure by creating millions of good-paying union jobs while combating climate change. Bernie’s moral clarity has emboldened the Democratic Party’s fight for justice. The grassroots energy of his supporters has amended important advances in our platform. Bernie will continue to lead a movement that helps defeat Trump and delivers transformational change. I’m excited to place into nomination the name of a great champion of the working class, Senator Bernie Sanders.  Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez: ( 55:00 ) Good evening, [Spanish 00:00:55:02], and thank you to everyone here today, endeavoring towards a better, more just future for our country and our world. Infidelity and gratitude to a mass people’s movement, working to establish 21st century social, economic, and human rights, including guaranteed healthcare, higher education, living wages, and labor rights for all people in the United States.  Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez: ( 55:29 ) A movement striving to recognize and repair the wounds of racial injustice, colonization, misogyny, and homophobia, and to propose and build re-imagined systems of immigration and foreign policy that turn away from the violence and xenophobia of our past. A movement that realizes the unsustainable brutality of an economy that rewards explosive inequalities of wealth for the few, at the expense of long-term stability for the many. And who organized a historic grassroots campaign to reclaim our democracy. In a time when millions of people in the United States are looking for deep, systemic solutions to our crises of mass evictions, unemployment, and lack of healthcare, and [Spanish 00:25:25], and out of a love for all people, I hereby second the nomination of Senator Bernard Sanders of Vermont for president of the United States of America.  Bennie Thompson: ( 56:39 ) Thank you, Mr. King and Representative Ocasio-Cortez. We now turn to nominating and seconding speeches for Vice President Biden. In a moment, we’ll hear from Senator Chris Coons, who holds the Delaware Senate seat once held by the Vice President, and representative Lisa Blunt Rochester, my colleague in the House. But first, we’ll hear from Jacquelyn Asbie, a working American who met Joe Biden in a most unexpected place, the elevator where she worked.  Jacquelyn Asbie: ( 57:14 ) I take powerful people up on my elevator all the time. When they get off, they go to their important meetings. Me, I just head back to the lobby. But in the short time I spent with Joe Biden, I could tell he really saw me, that he actually cared, that my life meant something to him. I knew even when he went into his important meeting, he’d take my story in there with him. That’s because Joe Biden has room in his heart for more than just himself.  Jacquelyn Asbie: ( 57:44 ) We’ve been through a lot and we have tough days ahead, but nominating someone like that to be in the White House is a good place to start. That’s why I nominate my friend, Joe Biden, as the next president of the United States.  Chris Coons: ( 58:05 ) I’m Senator Chris Coons from Delaware, a small state where people expect to see their senators and even sometimes their vice president at the supermarket, at a church festival, out in their community. Joe fights for us because he knows our struggles and hopes. He knows the pain of loss and the worries of working parents. And he’s always brought that same personal concern he showed for Jacquelyn to getting things done as our Senator and then as President Obama’s vice president.  Chris Coons: ( 58:34 ) Joe’s tackled gun violence and climate change. He stood up to dictators and supported our troops. He led the recovery effort after the last recession, and delivered on a promise to make our healthcare system fairer and stronger.  Chris Coons: ( 58:48 ) Through it all, Joe Biden’s never forgotten where he’s from. He’s been sustained by his faith and his family through the toughest of times. And he has the heart and the compassion for this moment. For all of these reasons and more, it’s my honor to second the nomination of my good friend, Joe Biden, to be the next president of these United States.  Lisa Blunt Rochester: ( 59:11 ) I’m Congresswoman Lisa Blunt Rochester. In some history class in the future, children are learning about this moment. They’re learning about our pain, our grief, our worry. But they’re also learning about a man named Joe Biden, about how he restored decency to our government and integrity to our democracy.  Lisa Blunt Rochester: ( 59:34 ) They’re learning about how we conquered a pandemic, stood united for racial justice, and built our economy back better than before. They’re learning about how his leadership gave their generation a fighting chance. They’re learning about us too, about the resolve and the unity we showed against the forces of hatred and division, about the work we will do over the next 11 weeks. And about the night when despite our distance, we came together to nominate Joe Biden for president of the United States. A nomination I’m honored to second.  Bennie Thompson: ( 01:00:13 ) Thank you all. Pursuant to our convention rules, we’ll now proceed to a roll call by states on the selection of our party’s candidate for the president of the United States. Secretary Rae?  Jason Rae: ( 01:00:35 ) Mr. Chairman, coming to you live from the Wisconsin Center, it’s time to begin our virtual trip around America. Our journey begins at the site of a major step forward in our national journey towards justice. Let’s go to Alabama.  Terri Sewell: ( 01:00:57 ) John Lewis marched across this bridge in 1965 to demand the right to vote. A lifetime later, civil rights and voting rights remain America’s great unfinished business.  Terri Sewell: ( 01:01:11 ) But those who walked this path before us showed us the way forward. If we want to honor John Lewis’s incredible life, let’s restore the Voting Rights Act and ensure that our democracy belongs to all Americans. Alabama casts eight votes for Bernie Sanders, and the great state of Alabama casts 52 votes for our next president of these United States, Joe Biden.  Jason Rae: ( 01:01:41 ) Alaska.  Chuck Degnan: ( 01:01:42 ) The waters we rely on to feed our families and make a living are threatened by climate change. When Joe Biden was vice president, he and President Obama made sure Alaska’s tribes had a say on how these waters were managed. Donald Trump took it away. We must elect the president who will respect our voices, protect our waters, and address climate change. Alaska casts seven votes for Bernie-  Chuck Degnan: ( 01:02:03 ) …for waters and address climate change. Alaska casts 7 votes for Bernie Sanders and 12 votes for the next President, Joe Biden.

Announcer: ( 01:02:44 ) Arizona.  Marisol Garcia: ( 01:02:45 ) As a middle school teacher, I know that public educators are doing everything they can to make sure our students have quality learning experiences this fall. As a mother of a high school freshman, I know that it’s far from perfect. As an NEA union organizer, I’ll fight to make sure that it’s scientists, parents, and educators that decide when it’s safe to go back to school, not politicians. As an Arizona Latina, I proudly cast our votes, 29 for Bernie Sanders and 51 for our next President, Joe Biden.  Announcer: ( 01:03:15 ) Arkansas.  Gilbert Alaquinez: ( 01:03:16 ) Feeding people is an act of love, and I think we all can use a little extra love these days, so we took our food trucks out into the community to deliver meals made right here at the Clinton Presidential Center for our neighbors in need.

Howard Chou: ( 01:04:17 ) Han and I grew up in poverty as immigrants, but we’ve been able to make a decent living. We’re extremely lucky, but now we have three family members that tested positive for COVID and it just doesn’t feel safe to put Evan and Emma back to school. This [inaudible 01:04:31] is going to be hard on them and on us, but millions of working families will have it much harder.

We raise families, pay taxes, and serve the United States military just like every American in the 50 states. The House of Representatives just passed an historic piece of legislation to make Washington, D.C., the 51st state. On Black Lives Matter Plaza, the District of Columbia proudly cast one vote for Bernie Sanders and 43 votes for the next President of the United States, Joe Biden.  Announcer: ( 01:06:32 ) Florida.  Fred Guttenberg: ( 01:06:37 ) When my daughter was murdered in Parkland, Joe Biden called to share in our family’s grief. I quickly learned about his decency and his civility, but I also learned about his toughness and how he’s beaten the NRA. Together with the other victims of gun violence and our nation’s youth, Joe Biden and Kamala Harris will take on the NRA again and win. Let’s win back our freedom to live without fear. Florida cast 57 votes for Bernie Sanders and 192 votes for our next President, Joe Biden.  Announcer: ( 01:07:08 ) Georgia.  Nikema Williams: ( 01:07:09 ) My mentor Congressman John Lewis knew that the right to vote is sacred. Georgians know that our ability to vote is under attack. Long lines, voter suppression.

Today, I want to speak to my fellow immigrants, to the essential workers on the front line, to the service members who wear our flag, to the parents with big dreams for their children. No matter where we came from, immigrants belong in our country’s long fight for justice. We belong in the America we are building together.

Christie Bell: ( 01:10:19 ) So while we have the honor of casting Iowa’s votes, 11 for Bernie Sanders and 38 for Joe Biden, we also want to ask for you to keep Iowans in your thoughts during this difficult time.

Geraldine Waller: ( 01:16:36 ) I work at a meatpacking plant, making sure grocery store shelves stay full. They call us essential workers, but we get treated like we’re expendable.

We want to keep helping you feed your family, but we need a President who will have our backs. Nebraska cast 33 votes for our next President, Joe Biden.  Announcer: ( 01:17:03 ) Nevada.

Announcer: ( 01:18:04 ) New Jersey.  Denis McDonough: ( 01:18:05 ) We’ve been hit hard by COVID, but we’re coming back. But we have to be smart.

New Mexico is a diverse state, home to 23 indigenous sovereign nations with a rich multicultural history.

Joe Biden’s plan will help us take better care of your loved ones as well as our own. Along with Lieutenant Governor Kathy Hochul, I cast New York’s votes, 44 votes for Bernie Sanders and 277 for our next President, Joe Biden. It’s Joe time.  Announcer: ( 01:20:11 ) North Carolina.  Cozzie Watkins: ( 01:20:13 ) I’ve been doing this for a long time, so let me just be plain. Black people, especially black women, are the backbone of this party, and if we don’t show up, Democrats don’t get elected. I’m putting on my mask and we’re going to every corner in North Carolina to help organize, because we need to make sure everyone shows up for Joe Biden. He would show up for us. North Carolina cast 39 votes for Bernie Sanders and 83 votes for the next President of the United States, Joe Biden.  Announcer: ( 01:20:46 ) North Dakota.

I graduated from a class of just 44 students and I had to drive three hours just to take the SATs, but growing up, I knew that college was a ladder that could take you anywhere.

[foreign language 00:19:49] and thank you.  Announcer: ( 01:21:55 ) Ohio.  Josh Abernathy: ( 01:21:56 ) It seems like every time working people believe in a Donald Trump promise, they wind up getting screwed. Well, Joe Biden has more than just a promise. He actually has a plan to bring jobs back to America…  Tim Ryan: ( 01:22:10 ) …like electric vehicles or a national network of vehicle-charging infrastructure that’ll create good-paying jobs for skilled union workers like Josh, and the future will be made in America. Ohio cast 20 votes for Senator Bernie Sanders and 134 votes for the next President, Joe Biden. O-H!  Josh Abernathy: ( 01:22:31 ) I-O!  Announcer: ( 01:22:34 ) Oklahoma.

Bob Casey: ( 01:23:35 ) When Joe Biden was young, his father came to this house in Scranton, sat down on Joe’s bed, and told him he lost his job. It’s a moment that stayed with Joe his entire life. Right now, all across America, working families are experiencing that same fear and uncertainty, but Joe Biden has a plan to help them and to help our country build back better, creating millions of good-paying jobs so more parents will be able to tell their kids what Joe’s dad said to him all those years ago. “It’s going to be okay.” Pennsylvania cast 34 votes for Senator Bernie Sanders and 175 votes for the next President of the United States, Scranton’s own Joe Biden.

Announcer: ( 01:26:06 ) South Dakota.  Kellen Returns From Scout: ( 01:26:07 ) [foreign language 00:24:07]. Relatives. As a First American and citizen of the Standing Rock Sioux tribe, I welcome you to the Paha Sapa, the Black Hills, the site of my creation story and home to the Oceti Sakowin, the great Sioux nation.

Keely Sage: ( 01:26:40 ) 100 years ago tonight, suffragists based here at the Hermitage Hotel in Nashville cheered as Tennessee became the 36th and deciding state to ratify the 19th Amendment, granting women the right to vote. This year, I’m casting my very first presidential vote for Joe Biden. Women will decide this election and will replace Donald Trump with a president who respects us. Tennessee cast 23 votes for Bernie Sanders and 50 votes for our next President of the United States, Mr. Joseph R. Biden.  Announcer: ( 01:27:15 ) Texas.  Veronica Escobar: ( 01:27:20 ) A year ago, my safe community of El Paso was targeted by a domestic terrorist who murdered 23 innocent people, injured 23 more, and devastated all of us. His motive was racism and xenophobia. In the face of hate, we choose love. [Spanish 00:25:35]. And in the face of continued gun violence in America, we demand change. The time has come to act. With one abstention, the great state of Texas casts 98 votes for Bernie Sanders and 161 votes for our next President, Joe Biden.  Announcer: ( 01:27:55 ) Utah.  Jenny Wilson: ( 01:27:56 ) Here in Utah, we’ve had mail-in voting for years. If you’re registered to vote, you automatically get sent a ballot. It’s fast, it’s reliable, and it’s easy for everyone to participate. In 2016, we had turnout well over 80%, and this year we’re expecting even higher. That’s why Democrats and Republicans here in Utah agree. Mail-in voting strengthens our democracy. Utah cast 17 votes for Bernie Sanders and 16 votes for our next President, Joe Biden.  Announcer: ( 01:28:28 ) Vermont.  David Zuckerman: ( 01:28:28 ) The state of Vermont, strongly believing in economic justice, social justice, racial justice, and environmental justice, proudly supporting democracy and the Constitution of the United States, and vehemently opposed to the authoritarianism and racism of the Trump administration, is proud to cast 15 votes for Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders and 9 votes for the next President of the United States, Joe Biden.  Announcer: ( 01:28:54 ) The US Virgin Islands.

We cast our 13 votes for Joseph R. Biden.  Announcer: ( 01:29:19 ) Virginia.  Khizr Khan: ( 01:29:20 ) Three years ago, my beloved city Charlottesville, Virginia, was attacked by white supremacists, and a young woman was killed. We were attacked again when Donald Trump praised those racists, turning his back on a community that just wanted peace. That was the day Joe Biden decided to join this battle for the soul of America. Over time, my wife Ghazala and I have come to know his soul. He’s a decent, compassionate man. He will bring this nation together. Virginia cast 32 votes for Bernie Sanders and 91 votes for our President, Joe Biden.  Announcer: ( 01:30:07 ) Washington.  My-Linh Thai: ( 01:30:08 ) [foreign language 00:28:07]. As a 15-year-old refugee from Vietnam, I knew that education was the key to finding opportunities in my new home. When having children of my own, I became an advocate to improve the public education system that gave me a chance to contribute to our America. Democrat invest in educations because we are committed to fighting for all kids. Washington cast 43 votes to Senator Bernie Sanders and 66 votes to our next President, Joe Biden.  Announcer: ( 01:30:41 ) West Virginia.  Fred Albert: ( 01:30:42 ) West Virginians have changed the narrative about public education. Parents, teachers, and service personnel have worked together to fight for safe and welcoming schools, sufficient funding for classroom equipment, and fair wages for teachers and school service personnel. Elections matter, but so does activism, so let’s keep fighting to guarantee a quality education for all our children, and let’s elect a President who will fight alongside us. West Virginia cast 34 votes for our next President, Joe Biden.  Announcer: ( 01:31:15 ) Wyoming.  Dennis Shepherd: ( 01:31:16 ) After our son Matthew’s death in Wyoming, Joe Biden helped pass legislation to protect LGBTQ Americans from hate crimes. Joe understands more than most our grief over Matt’s death, but we see in Joe so much of what made Matt’s life special: his commitment to equality, his passion for social justice, and his boundless compassion for others.  Judy Shepherd: ( 01:31:39 ) With three abstentions, Wyoming cast 4 votes for Bernie Sanders and 11 votes for the next President of the United States, Joe Biden.  Announcer: ( 01:31:48 ) Wisconsin.  Mandela Barnes: ( 01:31:50 ) Welcome back to Milwaukee, Wisconsin, a great city on native land on a Great Lake. It’s the place where I was born and raised right in the heart of 53206 zip code. This is a community that’s been faced with some significant challenges due to historical injustice, but what many don’t see is the joy, the resilience, and opportunity that lies within this community and so many others across America just like it, where hardworking people are fighting to provide for their families and to build a better future. We know that we build a better future for our nation by channeling Wisconsin’s legacy as the birthplace of the labor and the progressive movement, and uniting around a bold inclusive agenda that uplifts every community and the pursuit of a more just future, one that recognizes healthcare as a human right, one that tackles the climate crisis and takes on racial and economic justice. Wisconsin cast 30 votes for Bernie Sanders and 67 for the next President of the United States of America, Joseph R. Biden.  Announcer: ( 01:32:50 ) Delaware.  John Carney: ( 01:32:51 ) Long before this train station bore his name, you’d see Joe Biden up here on the platform with the rest of the crowd on his way to work or going home to his family. That’s always been his north star, delivering for f-  John Carney: ( 01:33:03 ) His family. That’s always been his North star, delivering for families like his own, working people who struggle and sacrifice to build a better life. Nobody has ever had to wonder who Joe Biden’s in it for.  Speaker 29: ( 01:33:13 ) Our nation faces daunting challenges, but I’ve known Joe Biden for 40 years. And there’s nobody I trust more to lead our party, unite our country and restore our standing in the world. What’s more, he’s humble, he tells the truth, he treats everybody he encounters with respect and builds bridges, not walls. He is a leader made for this moment, and the finest public servant I’ve ever known.  John Carney: ( 01:33:35 ) Delaware is proud to cast its 32 votes for our favorite son, and our next president.  Speaker 29: ( 01:33:41 ) Our friend, Delaware’s Joe Biden.  Joe Biden: ( 01:33:43 ) All right. Hey guys. How are you?  Speaker 30: ( 01:34:45 ) Thank you to all our delegations. I’m pleased to announce that vice president Joe Biden has officially been nominated by the democratic party as our candidate for President of the United States. Vice President Biden is hereby invited to deliver an acceptance speech.  Joe Biden: ( 01:35:09 ) Thank you very, very much from the bottom of my heart. Thank you all. It means the world to me and my family. And I’ll see you on Thursday. Thank you, thank you, thank you.  Tracee Ellis Ross: ( 01:35:21 ) That was so sweet with the grandkids. Yay. And now we have an official nominee. Onto the next step. Electing Joe Biden and Kamala Harris in November. Make sure you have a plan to vote. Text vote to 30330 to find out how. Now we’re going to talk about a topic that touches all of our lives. Healthcare. The Affordable Care Act was game-changing. This pandemic has revealed just how important it is to protect and improve it. Increasing access to healthcare and bringing down its cost have always been a priority for Joe Biden, because for Joe, and for all of us, healthcare is personal.  Speaker 31: ( 01:36:50 ) It’s the toughest battles that called for the steadiest leadership. Again and again, they were told to give up on affordable healthcare. They knew it would cost them politically.  Speaker 32: ( 01:37:00 ) The Republicans say this will prove to be unpopular.  Speaker 33: ( 01:37:03 ) Bill is a legislative train wreck.  Speaker 31: ( 01:37:05 ) But not nearly as much as it would cost the American people if they did nothing.  Joe Biden: ( 01:37:09 ) We are not going to slow up on providing affordable healthcare for Americans. Health care is a natural American right.  Speaker 31: ( 01:37:17 ) Giving up on the Affordable Care Act would have meant leaving 20 million without coverage out in the cold. But Joe Biden wasn’t about to give up, because he knew what it was like to stand in their shoes. He was sworn into the Senate next to a hospital bed. His wife and daughter had been killed in a car crash. And lying in that bed were his two sons. 40 years later, one of those little boys, his son, Beau was diagnosed with cancer, and given only months to live. It’s hard to imagine a greater grief than losing your child. But Joe always knew that his family was one of the lucky ones. After that accident, his son got 40 more years of life, all because he had healthcare.  Speaker 32: ( 01:38:17 ) Without objection, the motion to reconsider is laid on the table.  Speaker 31: ( 01:38:23 ) Now, it’s unthinkable that Donald Trump is trying to take that healthcare away. In the middle of a pandemic, he’s still trying to get rid of the Affordable Care Act. This fight is personal for Joe, as personal as it gets. So when Joe says he has a plan to strengthen the Affordable Care Act, protect those with preexisting conditions, and expand access to every American, he’s thinking about how having healthcare saved his boys. When his plan talks about lowering drug prices and making care more affordable, he’s thinking about Beau, who spent his final days in comfort because he was insured. Joe Biden knows what affordable healthcare means to American families, because of what it’s meant to his.  Joe Biden: ( 01:39:17 ) This is my promise to you. When I’m president, I will take care of your healthcare coverage and your family the same way I would my own. For that’s what the presidency is, the duty to care. To care for all of us, not just those who vote for us, but all of us. This job is not about me. It’s about you. It’s about us.  Speaker 33: ( 01:39:43 ) [inaudible 01:39:48].  Joe Biden: ( 01:39:49 ) How are you? You handsome boy.  Steve Gomez: ( 01:39:53 ) He was born in ’15, and with a heart condition known as transposition of the greater arteries, and ended up requiring a transplant. And thankfully, the ACA had already taken effect. But now, that’s something that we think about all the time, especially with his coverage, and the potential of coverage maxes, and his initial hospital stay was over $3 million, that was billed back to the insurance.  Joe Biden: ( 01:40:17 ) I remember thinking as Beau lay dying in bed, and we lie in bed with him, his brother and I, and his sister. And thinking to myself, what in God’s name would I do, if the doctor walked in and said, “I’m sorry, you have outrun your insurance. You’ve reached your cap, suffer the last few months of your life on your own.”  Jeff Jeans: ( 01:40:40 ) I came from a near part of the country where rural Missouri, where basically everybody was Republican, and I was a Republican, and I lost my voice. And we put off going to the doctor, because we didn’t have health insurance. When we finally got into somebody that could take a look in my throat, they said, “Wow, you’ve got cancer.” It was stage four, the worst kind of cancer you can have. My wife applied for insurance through the Affordable Care Act. And my coverage began on April 1st in 2012. And that same day they started my chemo and radiation. And it saved my life. I’m here today.  Dr. Angie Taylor: ( 01:41:28 ) Generally speaking as a church, you’re concerned about people spiritually, but you’re also concerned about other areas of their life. And that includes their physical or physiological wellbeing, because the Bible talks about all of us. But there are people in our country, and in fact, people in my church that can’t take advantage of it, because they don’t have good healthcare. That’s definitely discouraging to me and that’s pretty discouraging to them.  Julie Buckholt: ( 01:41:55 ) Because of the Myasthenia gravis, and the fact that it’s a very rare disease, a lot of our medications we have to fight for. And before the ACA, we worried about our medications. We worried about the preexisting conditions for our children. We worried about age, and the cap, because having that cost of the medications, we would have reached that million dollar cap in no time. But once the ACA passed, we no longer had that cap of the million dollars.  Joe Biden: ( 01:42:31 ) The fear that you all live in, understandably, if somehow, tomorrow they said, “No insurance, you’re not covered,” is just devastating. Hey Laura, how are you doing?  Laura Packard: ( 01:42:48 ) [crosstalk 01:42:48] again.  Joe Biden: ( 01:42:48 ) How are you doing?  Laura Packard: ( 01:42:49 ) Doing well.  Joe Biden: ( 01:42:50 ) Well, you beat Hodgkin’s lymphoma. God love you. But during it all, Trump was trying to rip away your coverage. The day you got your first chemo, Republicans voted to gut the ACA. I can’t imagine what it must’ve been like going to sleep at night, wondering what to do.  Laura Packard: ( 01:43:07 ) Ever since I was diagnosed, every night, I’d go to bed concerned about what news I would get in the morning. And even still, even today, they’re still trying to take away our healthcare. Even during a pandemic.  Joe Biden: ( 01:43:22 ) Look, we’re going to make sure we don’t lose that ACA, we’re going to provide a Medicare-like option as a public option, and any state if you qualify for Medicaid, and the state hasn’t provided it, you’d automatically be enrolled. I’m going to protect you like I tried to protect my own family, my own family. And I promise you that.  Eugene F.: ( 01:43:43 ) I met Joe last year at a campaign event to thank him for all being so involved in the battle to cure cancer. Indeed I have what’s been diagnosed with terminal cancer. The inspiration and the empathy and the human love that he shared with me has kept me going.  Lisa P.: ( 01:44:03 ) I made an appointment for my wellness checkup provided for by the Affordable Care Act. I was told that I had ovarian cancer. I finished my course of treatment. And since then, I’ve been cancer-free. And I am very grateful for that.  Jacqueline A.: ( 01:44:19 ) I chose to become a Joe Biden delegate as I watch with our nation as President Donald Trump sought to dismantle the Affordable Care Act.  Eugene F.: ( 01:44:29 ) My purpose in life right now is to devote all my energy to getting Joe elected.  Jacqueline A.: ( 01:44:35 ) I anxiously jumped at the chance to become a Biden delegate.  Lisa P.: ( 01:44:39 ) He will continue to strengthen the Affordable Care Act so that diseases like cancer don’t go undetected.  Ady Barkan: ( 01:44:45 ) Hey Carl, it’s me, dad. By the time you’re watching this, you will have grown up to be strong and courageous, but I don’t know how much longer I’ll be around for you. I was diagnosed with ALS today, which is a deadly debilitating disease. After I was diagnosed, the president passed a tax bill that put my healthcare at risk. So I went to Washington, DC.  Speaker 34: ( 01:45:33 ) My next guest made headlines when he confronted a Republican Senator on an airplane.  Ady Barkan: ( 01:45:37 ) You can be an American hero. I wanted to help create a better country for you to live in.  Ady Barkan: ( 01:45:43 ) Democracy is beautiful.  Crowd: ( 01:45:43 ) Democracy is beautiful.  Ady Barkan: ( 01:45:49 ) All that matters to me is to make you proud, because I’m already so proud of you. Hello America. My name is Ady Barkan, and I am speaking to you through this computer voice because I have been paralyzed by a mysterious illness called ALS. Like so many of you, I have experienced the ways our healthcare system is fundamentally broken. Enormous costs, denied claims, dehumanizing treatment when we are most in need. Since my shocking diagnosis, I have traveled the country meeting countless patients like me demanding more of our representatives and our democracy. Today, we are witnessing the tragic consequences of our failing healthcare system. In the midst of a pandemic, nearly a hundred million Americans do not have sufficient health insurance. And even good insurance does not cover essential needs like long-term care.  Ady Barkan: ( 01:46:56 ) Our loved ones are dying in unsafe nursing homes. Our nurses are overwhelmed and unprotected, and our essential workers are treated as dispensable. We live in the richest country in history, and yet we do not guarantee this most basic human right. Everyone living in America should get the healthcare they need, regardless of their employment status or ability to pay. Even during this terrible crisis, Donald Trump and Republican politicians are trying to take away millions of people’s health insurance. With the existential threat of another four years of this president, we all have a profound obligation to act. Not only to vote, but to make sure that our friends, family, and neighbors vote as well. We must elect Joe Biden. Each of us must be a hero for our communities, for our country, and then with a compassionate and intelligent president, we must act together and put on his desk a bill that guarantees us all the healthcare we deserve. Text vote to 30330 to learn how to vote safely, because our lives depend on it.  Tracee Ellis Ross: ( 01:48:07 ) Politics and elections can seem like these far away things that one person doesn’t have the power to change. But what’s happening in our country right now makes it clear how personal politics are. I’ve discovered that when I get informed and participate, my fear gets smaller. Voting is a big part of that. So knowing the change you want, vote for the leaders you think will make it happen. And if you’re able, if you can, help fund this campaign. Please go to JoeBiden.com, and chip in whatever you can. With leaders like Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, we can build back better here at home, and once again strengthen our nation’s security and standing in the world.  Demarcus G.: ( 01:48:59 ) My name is DeMarcus Gilliard. I’m 34 years old, and I currently live in Los Angeles, California. I’m a 2009 graduate of the US Naval Academy in Annapolis, and I served on active duty in the Marine Corps as an officer for six years. I took an oath to support, uphold and defend the constitution of the United States of America. And I know that Joe Biden in his years of public service took a similar oath, and he understands the sacrifice of the men and women in uniform who are overseas right now fighting for the ideals of this nation. That liberty and justice can be extended to all people. I know that Joe Biden understands that at his core, I trust him to lead us on day one into a greater future. There’s nothing more important for me right now in making sure that we restore the soul of our nation. And I think that Joe Biden is the best person to do that. Thanks, Joe.  John Kerry: ( 01:49:56 ) Hi, I’m John Kerry. For the eight years of the Obama/Biden administration, we led by example. We eliminated the threat of Iran with a nuclear weapon. We built a 68 nation coalition to destroy ISIS. We forged 195 nation agreement to attack climate change. We stopped Ebola before it became a pandemic. Donald Trump inherited a growing economy and a more peaceful world. And like everything else he inherited, he bankrupted it. When this president goes overseas, it isn’t a goodwill mission, it’s a blooper reel. He breaks up with our allies and writes love letters to dictators. America deserves a president who is looked up to, not laughed at. Donald Trump pretends Russia didn’t attack our elections. And now he does nothing about Russia putting a bounty on our troops. So he won’t defend our country, he doesn’t know how to defend our troops, the only person he’s interested in defending is himself.  John Kerry: ( 01:51:13 ) This is the bottom line, our interests, our ideals, and our brave men and women in uniform can’t afford four more years of Donald Trump. Our troops can’t get out of harm’s way by hiding in the White House bunker. They need a president who will stand up for them. And President Biden will. Joe’s moral compass has always pointed in the right direction, from the fight to break the back of Apartheid, to the struggle to wake up the world to genocide in the Balkans. Joe understands that none of the issues of this world, not nuclear weapons, not the challenge of building back better after COVID, not terrorism, and certainly not the climate crisis. None can be resolved without bringing nations together with strength, and humility. Joe understands our values don’t limit our power, they magnify it. He knows you can’t spread democracy around the world if you don’t practice it at home.  John Kerry: ( 01:52:12 ) And he knows that even the United States of America needs friends on this planet. Before Donald Trump, we used to talk about American exceptionalism. The only thing exceptional about the incoherent Trump foreign policy is that it has made our nation more isolated than ever before. Joe Biden knows we aren’t exceptional because we bluster that we are, we are exceptional because we do exceptional things. On June 6th, 1944, young Americans gave their lives and the beaches of Normandy to liberate the world from tyranny. Out of the ashes of that war we made peace and rebuilt the world. That was, and remains exceptional. It is the opposite of everything Donald Trump stands for. This moment is a fight for the security of America, and the world. Only Joe Biden can make America lead like America again. If you agree, text join to 30330. Thank you.  Brett Mcgurk: ( 01:53:23 ) In the Situation Room, presidents make decisions of war and peace. So when Joe Biden walks into the Situation Room, first and foremost in his mind is how will my decision impact the lives of the American people.  Marie Y.: ( 01:53:36 ) He is experienced. He has made the tough calls.  Chuck Hagel: ( 01:53:39 ) He’s got courage. He’s got tremendous courage, character, judgment, and he can be tough. I witnessed it, close up.  Linda Greenfield: ( 01:53:45 ) Joe Biden is decisive and well prepared for any issue.  Chuck Hagel: ( 01:53:50 ) There is no one more qualified than Joe Biden to be sitting at the head of the table in the Situation Room making decisions for this country.  Linda Greenfield: ( 01:53:58 ) Having sent his son to war, I don’t think anyone can be more ready than vice president Biden.  Jack Weinstein: ( 01:54:05 ) He knows exactly what’s at stake when he sends our troops overseas.  Rose G.: ( 01:54:08 ) Biden understands how important it is to have allies standing together with us. They are force multipliers.  Brett Mcgurk: ( 01:54:16 ) Joe Biden has the unique ability to connect with people. He knows the leaders, and he’s dealt with them for years, he knows what makes them tick.  Marie Y.: ( 01:54:22 ) They trust him, they trust his judgment, and they know that his word is good.  Tom C.: ( 01:54:25 ) I know that Biden’s personal diplomacy will save American lives.  Linda Greenfield: ( 01:54:30 ) To build these relationships takes decades, and to tear them down, all it takes is a Tweet.  Tom C.: ( 01:54:36 ) Thanks to Donald Trump, our adversaries are stronger, and bolder.  Rose G.: ( 01:54:41 ) Donald Trump has had a love fest with dictators, including China and Russia. He hasn’t been standing up to them at all.  Jack Weinstein: ( 01:54:47 ) I served in the United States Air Force for 36 years. I’ve led space squadrons, nuclear missile squadrons, and I never thought I would have a president who is a danger to national security.  Chuck Hagel: ( 01:54:57 ) President Trump has degraded and debased the presidency and our country in the eyes of the world.  Jack Weinstein: ( 01:55:03 ) The Russians offered bounties on US soldiers. I was shocked when I read that. But the president didn’t even asked Vladimir Putin about it. That’s un-American.  Chuck Hagel: ( 01:55:12 ) There’s something wrong with that. I mean, that’s a dereliction of duty. You’re failing the troops. You’re failing this country.  Jack Weinstein: ( 01:55:17 ) The first thing a president needs to do is find out what the facts are. This president doesn’t care about facts.  Tom C.: ( 01:55:23 ) Biden cares about the safety and welfare of American servicemen and women.  Brett Mcgurk: ( 01:55:30 ) Our military had a policy to maintain our presence in Syria, we actually came to the aid of the Kurds against ISIS and we help stop the advance. President Trump told us to simply abandon the Kurds. It’s shameful.  Rose G.: ( 01:55:41 ) Joe Biden will be strong against dictators.  Brett Mcgurk: ( 01:55:44 ) I’ve heard him on the phone with some pretty tough characters. You talk about Joe Biden’s empathy, his decency, but Joe Biden is tough as nails, and everybody knows it.  Marie Y.: ( 01:55:53 ) He will do the right thing, no matter the political cost.  Brett Mcgurk: ( 01:55:57 ) I’ve served for two Republican presidents, and one Democratic president. I have seen the Trump administration make decisions without any thought, without any preparation that have massive life and death consequences.  Chuck Hagel: ( 01:56:10 ) At one of the most defining times in the history of the world, Joe Biden is uniquely qualified to be president of the United States.  Jack Weinstein: ( 01:56:17 ) If you want a strong America, you want Joe Biden.  Colin Powell: ( 01:56:21 ) Hi, I’m former Secretary of State Colin Powell. 100 years ago, a young immigrant left a dirt farm in Jamaica and set out for America. Three years later, a ship pulled into New York Harbor, and a young Jamaican woman gazed up at the Statue of Liberty for the first time. They became my parents, and they inspired me to finish college and join the army. This began a journey of service that would take me from basic training to combat in Vietnam, up the ranks to serve as chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, and secretary of state.  Colin Powell: ( 01:56:53 ) The values I learned growing up in the South Bronx, and serving in uniform were the same values that Joe Biden’s parents instilled in him in Scranton, Pennsylvania. I support Joe Biden for the presidency of the United States, because those values still define him. And we need to restore those values to the White House. Our country needs a commander in chief who takes care of our troops in the same way he would his own family. For Joe Biden, that doesn’t need teaching, it comes from the experience he shares with millions of military families, sending his beloved son off to war, and praying to God he would come home safe. Joe Biden will be a president we will all be proud to salute. With Joe Biden in the White House, you will never doubt that he will stand with our friends, and stand up to our adversaries, never the other way around. He will trust our diplomats and our intelligence community, not the flattery of dictators and despots.  Colin Powell: ( 01:57:48 ) He will make it his job to know when anyone dares to threaten us, he will stand up to our adversaries with strength and experience. They will know he means business. I support Joe Biden because beginning on day one, he will restore Americans leadership, and our moral authority. He’ll be a president who knows that America is strongest when, as he has said, we lead both by the power of our example, and the example of our power. He will restore America’s leadership in the world and restore the alliances we need to address the dangers that threaten our nation, from climate change to nuclear proliferation. Today, we are a country divided, and we have a president doing everything in his power to make it that way, and keep us that way. What a difference it will make to have a president who unites us, who restores our strength, and our soul. I still believe that in our hearts, we are the same America that brought my parents to our shores, an America that inspires freedom around the world. That’s the America Joe Biden will lead is our next president. Thank you very much.  Speaker 35: ( 01:58:56 ) It was a friendship that shouldn’t have worked. John, a former Navy pilot just released from a North Vietnamese prison, Joe, a young Senator from Delaware. But in the 1970s, Joe was assigned a military aid for a trip overseas.  John McCain: ( 01:59:20 ) I was a Navy Senate liaison, and used to carry your bags on overseas trips.  Joe Biden: ( 01:59:25 ) This son of a gun never carried my bags. He was supposed to carry my bags dammit, but he never carried my bags.  Speaker 35: ( 01:59:36 ) John and Joe traveled thousands of miles together. Their families got to know each other, gathering for picnics in the Biden’s backyard.  Cindy McCain: ( 01:59:46 ) They would just sit and joke. It was like a comedy show sometimes to watch the two of them.  Speaker 35: ( 01:59:53 ) But when John was elected to the Senate as a Republican from Arizona, they found themselves on opposing sides.  John McCain: ( 02:00:02 ) We’re in different parties. We hold different views on many issues.  Ted Kaufman: ( 02:00:06 ) They’d be going at it on the floor, and you’d think, oh, these guys must really, really, really dislike each other. And they’d be having dinner that night together.  Cecillia Munoz: ( 02:00:16 ) Senator Biden had great respect for the institution of the Senate. He built relationships that were cordial, that were personal.  Joe Biden: ( 02:00:25 ) We’ve always been willing when we thought the other guy was right to cross the aisle and lock arms. It’s good for the country.  Ron Klain: ( 02:00:36 ) It takes trust to get things done in a divided government. And I think with Joe Biden, his colleagues knew that your points were equally valid to him.  Speaker 35: ( 02:00:47 ) Even if a deal seemed out of reach, it was always Joe who tried to cross the aisle.  Ted Kaufman: ( 02:00:53 ) He was like a natural for that. He just had an ability to find the common ground, but never give up your principles.  Speaker 35: ( 02:00:59 ) For three decades, Joe was able to move his colleagues and find a way forward. On violence against women, banning chemical weapons, assault weapons, and controlling nuclear arms.  Cindy McCain: ( 02:01:13 ) It was a style of legislating and leadership that you don’t find much anymore.  Speaker 35: ( 02:01:21 ) And when millions of Americans were faced with losing their health insurance, it was Joe’s friend who saved Obamacare by crossing the aisle.  Speaker 36: ( 02:01:29 ) McCain passed his vote with a thumbs down.  Joe Biden: ( 02:01:33 ) John and I have been given several awards about bipartisanship. We don’t understand why you should get an award for bipartisanship.  John McCain: ( 02:01:41 ) Thank you for your example of how to remain the same good guy that you were when you first got here. Most of all, for your friendship, my life and the lives of many have been enriched by it.  Jill Biden: ( 02:02:01 ) Love you.  Joe Biden: ( 02:02:01 ) Love you.  Jill Biden: ( 02:02:09 ) I have a rule that I never think of anything negative when I’m running. When I set my mind to something, I find a way to get it done.  Joe Biden: ( 02:02:23 ) She is so damn tough and loyal. When I met Jill, I knew, my brother said, “There’s this this woman, you’ll really like her Joe.” So I gave her a call, and she had a date that night.  Jill Biden: ( 02:02:37 ) You said, “Do you think you could break your date?”  Joe Biden: ( 02:02:40 ) Oh, that’s right. And what’d you do?  Jill Biden: ( 02:02:44 ) Well, I called and told the guy that I had a friend in from out of town, and went out with Joe.  Joe Biden: ( 02:02:50 ) I was 30, and I was a Senator, and I was a widower. Several years earlier, a tractor trailer broadsided my wife and three children. My wife was killed. My daughter was killed. I wasn’t big on the whole date scene thing. But when I met Jill, I fell in love with her when I saw her.  Jill Biden: ( 02:03:15 ) He said, “I’d really like to see you again.” So he’s looking at his calendar, and he’s, “Oh Thursday, no, no, I’m really busy. No, I’m busy Friday. How about tomorrow?” And I thought, “Buddy, you just blew your cover.”  Joe Biden: ( 02:03:36 ) She’s owned me since then. The boys fell in love with Jill too. I’m brushing my teeth one morning, and they came running in, and Beau and Hunt said, “Dad, we think it’s time we married Jill.” Swear to God. I asked her to marry me five times.  Jill Biden: ( 02:03:55 ) It wasn’t just my heart that was on the line. And I loved the boys so much. I had to be sure that it had to be forever.  Dr. Jill Biden: ( 02:04:03 ) There’s so much. I had to be sure that it had to be forever.  Joe Biden: ( 02:04:03 ) “Now I’m going to ask you one more time, will you marry me?” And she goes like this, “Okay.” She put us back together. She gave me back my life. She gave us back a family. We are raised with the same values.  Dr. Jill Biden: ( 02:04:30 ) I grew up in Willow Grove, Pennsylvania, right outside of Philly. My mom was English-Scottish and my dad was Italian. My grandmother made the homemade noodles that would hang and she’d be drying her noodles.  Joe Biden: ( 02:04:49 ) They’re very close family. She’s the oldest of five girls.  Speaker 37: ( 02:04:53 ) She’s like the godmother of all of us.  Speaker 38: ( 02:04:57 ) I think we’ve all seen the feistiness in her.  Speaker 39: ( 02:05:00 ) There was a bully in my school. She marched up the street and knocked on his door.  Dr. Jill Biden: ( 02:05:05 ) And I punched him right in the face. My father fought in World War II. He was a signalman in the Navy and he was very patriotic. He would take us to watch the Blue Angels and he was so proud. We worshiped our mother. I can picture her so well reading for hours. She just loved to read. And that had a great influence on me. I went to college at the University of Delaware. Then I taught in the high schools. I mean, I got up every single day so excited to go teach. When I married Joe, I took off time to establish myself as the boy’s mom. We don’t use the term stepmother.  Joe Biden: ( 02:05:54 ) Beau and Hunter said, “No, we have a mom and a mommy. My mommy died. This is our mom.” And then along came Ashley and-  Dr. Jill Biden: ( 02:06:04 ) A family was complete.  Joe Biden: ( 02:06:05 ) Yeah.  Ashley Biden: ( 02:06:05 ) When I was growing up, mom was fun. The [inaudible 02:06:16] started when I was a teenager. There was some conflicts, she dealt with it by taking a parenting. She started to basically run marathons.  Joe Biden: ( 02:06:31 ) I never ever doubted anything she set her mind that she could do. I got to hand her, her doctorate degree in education at the University of Delaware.  Dr. Jill Biden: ( 02:06:42 ) Come on, let’s turn it positive. So you will pass it.  Naomi Biden: ( 02:06:48 ) I would say, she’s not your average grandmother. She’s the grandmother who wakes you up at like, what was it? Like 5:00 AM on Christmas Eve to go soul cycling.  Natalie Biden: ( 02:06:58 ) Yeah. We have a lot of stories.  Naomi Biden: ( 02:07:02 ) Yeah. She’s a praying star. She’s very mischievous. When she goes on a run, sometimes she’ll find a dead snake and she’ll pick it up and put it in a bag and she’ll use it to scare someone.  Amb. Cathy Russell: ( 02:07:16 ) That’s a classic Jill. She wasn’t really a Washington person and I don’t think ever imagined herself being part of that.  Dr. Jill Biden: ( 02:07:26 ) When Joe was elected to vice president, I just thought, Hey, I got to step it up here because there are things that I really care about. Having had a father in the military, having a son deployed in Iraq, I saw the need to support military families.  Ashley Williams: ( 02:07:47 ) Dr. Biden could draw anyone in and they felt like they were talking to an old friend. That is one of her super powers.  Amb. Cathy Russell: ( 02:07:54 ) When she was second lady, Jill told me that she would like to continue teaching at community college. And I said, “That’s insane. You cannot possibly do that.”  Dr. Jill Biden: ( 02:08:06 ) And I said, “I know I can do both jobs.”  Amb. Cathy Russell: ( 02:08:09 ) I never saw her on any day of the week where she wasn’t carrying a huge stack of papers to grade.  Joe Biden: ( 02:08:15 ) As second lady, she was teaching full time for eight years, 15 credits a semester.  Dr. Jill Biden: ( 02:08:23 ) These were students who wanted to be in your classroom. And I saw their tenacity and they were taking care of children, just like I had done.  Yvette Lewis: ( 02:08:32 ) She gave 100% from her energy to the students. She’s a great teacher.  Joe Biden: ( 02:08:39 ) Teaching is not what Jill does, it’s who she is. Jill just simply cares. She cares about other people.  Dr. Jill Biden: ( 02:08:50 ) When Beau was diagnosed with brain cancer, nobody knew what we were going through. The secret service, they’re not supposed to react to your life or what you’re doing. They would whisper, “I’m praying for you.”  Hunter Biden: ( 02:09:10 ) It’s your strength that holds this family together. And I know that you will make us whole again.  Dr. Jill Biden: ( 02:09:23 ) You never stop grieving, ever, but you do have to find purpose. Please welcome my husband, Joe Biden. Running for president is too tough to not be together.  Speaker 39: ( 02:09:39 ) The future first lady of the United States.  Speaker 38: ( 02:09:40 ) That’s right?  Dr. Jill Biden: ( 02:09:41 ) There you go.  Ashley Williams: ( 02:09:43 ) If Dr. Biden is our first lady, the country will be getting one of the best humans that we have.  Amb. Cathy Russell: ( 02:09:52 ) She has been through some really tough things in her own life. And she knows how hard it can be.  Joe Biden: ( 02:09:58 ) American people are in her heart. I know that she fight like [inaudible 02:10:00].  Dr. Jill Biden: ( 02:10:03 ) We all need community. We needed to depend on others for our strength. All American families, we all need each other.  Speaker 40: ( 02:10:22 ) And now please welcome Dr. Jill Biden.  Dr. Jill Biden: ( 02:10:32 ) I have always loved the sounds of a classroom. The quiet that sparks with possibility just before students shuffle in, the murmur of ideas bouncing back and forth as we explore the world together. The laughter and tiny moments of surprise you find in materials you’ve taught a million times. When I taught English here at Brandywine high school, I would spend my summer preparing for the school year about to start filled with anticipation. But this quiet is heavy. You can hear the anxiety that echoes down empty hallways. There’s no scent of new notebooks or freshly waxed floors. The rooms are dark as the bright young faces that should fill them are now confined to boxes on a computer screen. I hear it from so many of you, the frustration of parents juggling work while they support their children’s learning are afraid that their kids might get sick from school. The concern of every person working without enough protection, the despair in the lines that stretch out before food banks, and the indescribable sorrow that follows every lonely last breath when the ventilators turn off.  Dr. Jill Biden: ( 02:12:08 ) As a mother and a grandmother, as an American, I am heartbroken by the magnitude of this loss, by the failure to protect our communities by every precious and irreplaceable life gone. Like so many of you, I’m left asking, How do I keep my family safe? Motherhood came to me in a way I never expected. I fell in love with a man and two little boys standing in the wreckage of unthinkable loss, mourning a wife, and mother, a daughter, and sister. I never imagined at the age of 26, I would be asking myself, how do you make a broken family whole? Still Joe always told the boys, mommy sent Jill to us. And how could I argue with her?  Dr. Jill Biden: ( 02:13:13 ) And so we figured it out together in those big moments that we’d go by too fast, Thanksgivings, and state championships, birthdays, and weddings in the mundane ones, that we didn’t even know were shaping our lives. Reading stories, pile on the couch, rowdy Sunday dinners and silly arguments, listening to the fate sounds of laughter that would float downstairs as Joe put the kids to bed every night, while I studied for grad school or graded papers under the pale yellow kitchen lamp, the dinner dishes waiting in the sink.  Dr. Jill Biden: ( 02:13:57 ) We found that love holds a family together. Love makes us flexible and resilient. It allows us to become more than ourselves together. And though it can’t protect us from the sorrows of life, it gives us refuge, a home. How do you make a broken family whole? The same way you make a nation hole, with love and understanding, and with small acts of kindness, with bravery, with unwavering faith. You show up for each other in big ways and small ones again and again. It’s what so many of you are doing right now for your loved ones, for complete strangers, for your communities. There are those who want to tell us that our country is hopelessly divided, that our differences are irreconcilable, but that’s not what I’ve seen over these last few months. We’re coming together and holding onto each other. We’re finding mercy and grace in the moments we might have once taken for granted. We’re seeing that our differences are precious and our similarities, infinite. We have shown that the heart of this nation still beats with kindness and courage. That’s the soul of America Joe Biden is fighting for now.  Dr. Jill Biden: ( 02:15:37 ) After our son, Beau, died of cancer, I wondered if I would ever smile or feel joy again. It was summer, but there was no warmth left for me. Four days after Beau’s funeral, I watched Joe shave and put on his suit. I saw him still himself in the mirror, take a breath, put his shoulders back, and walk out into a world empty of our son. He went back to work. That’s just who he is.  Dr. Jill Biden: ( 02:16:15 ) There are times when I couldn’t even imagine how he did it, how he put one foot in front of the other and kept going. But I’ve always understood why he did it, for the daughter who convinces her mom to finally get a breast cancer screening and misses work to drive her to the clinic, for the community college student who has faced homelessness and survived abuse, but binds the grit to finish her degree and make a good life for her kids. For the little boy whose mom is serving as a Marine in Iraq, who puts on a brave face in his video call and doesn’t complain when the only thing he wants for his birthday is to be with her. For all those people, Joe gives his personal phone number to, at rope lines and events. The ones he talks to for hours after dinner, helping them smile through their loss, letting them know that they aren’t alone. He does it for you.  Dr. Jill Biden: ( 02:17:24 ) Joe’s purpose has always driven him forward. His strength of will is unstoppable and his faith is unshakable. Because it’s not in politicians or political parties or even in himself, it’s in the Providence of God. His faith is in you, in us. Yes, so many classrooms are quiet right now, the playgrounds are still. But if you listen closely, you can hear the sparks of change in the air across this country. Educators, parents, first responders, Americans of all walks of life are putting their shoulders back, fighting for each other. We haven’t given up. We just need leadership worthy of our nation, worthy of you, honest leadership to bring us back together, to recover from this pandemic and prepare for whatever else is next.  Dr. Jill Biden: ( 02:18:36 ) Leadership to reimagine what our nation will be. That’s Joe. He and Kamala will work as hard as you do every day to make this nation better. And if I have the honor of serving as your first lady, I will too. And with Joe, as president, these classrooms will ring out with laughter and possibility once again. The burdens we carry are heavy and we need someone with strong shoulders. I know that if we entrust this nation to Joe, he will do for your family what he did for ours, bring us together and make us whole, carry us forward in our time of need, keep the promise of America for all of us.  Joe Biden: ( 02:19:41 ) Great. God, I love you. Hey everyone, I’m Jill Biden’s husband. As you heard tonight, excuse me. You can see why she’s the love of my life and the rock of our family. She never gives herself much credit, but the truth is she’s the strongest person I know. She’s a backbone like a ramrod. She loves fiercely, cares deeply. Nothing stops her when she sets her mind to getting something right. And for all of you out there across the country, just think of your favorite educator who gave you the confidence to believe in yourself. That’s the kind of first lady this Jill Biden will be. God, I love you.  Dr. Jill Biden: ( 02:20:25 ) So joebiden.com to join our campaign.  Joe Biden: ( 02:20:27 ) Thank you all for watching. I’ll see you soon. Thank you.  Speaker 41: ( 02:20:47 ) Thank you so much for being a part of this night. As Dr. Biden just reminded us, Joe is a steady and experienced leader who can bring us together and help us heal. He will support us in getting better. Remember we bend the arc of justice. If we participate, if we vote, this moment isn’t beyond you. It’s up to you. Tomorrow night, we’ll meet Joe Biden’s choice for vice president, Kamala Harris and learn more about their vision for the future of our country. And we’ll also hear from Senator Elizabeth Warren and President Barack Obama, plus performances from Billie Eilish and Jennifer Hudson. And now with his song Never Break, here’s John Legend.  John Legend: ( 02:21:47 ) (Singing).  Speaker 41: ( 02:24:57 ) Tonight is all about leadership.  Speaker 42: ( 02:25:00 ) We’ll work to meet our extraordinary challenges because progress is made by the hopeful, not the cynical. And we will do that work together because movements are built by the many, not the few.  Speaker 43: ( 02:25:12 ) Faced with a president of cowardice, Joe Biden is a man of proven courage. He will restore our moral compass by confronting our challenges, not by hiding from them or undermining our elections to keep his job.  Speaker 44: ( 02:25:26 ) We need a president who respects our laws and the privilege of public service, who reflects our values and cares about our people.  Speaker 45: ( 02:25:35 ) In this job interview the difference is start. You know what Donald Trump will do with four more years, blame, blame, and belittle. And you know what Joe Biden will do, build back better.  Speaker 46: ( 02:25:48 ) Joe understands our values don’t limit our power, they magnify them. He knows you can’t spread democracy around the world if you don’t practice it at home.  Speaker 47: ( 02:25:57 ) Joe Biden will be a president we will all be proud to salute.  Dr. Jill Biden: ( 02:26:01 ) I know that if we entrust this nation to Joe, he will do for your family what he did for ours, bring us together and make us whole, carry us forward in our time of need. Keep the promise of America for all of us.  Mariann Budde: ( 02:26:27 ) I’m Mariann Budde, Bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Washington, DC. And I’m honored to offer the benediction tonight. Hear these words from pastor, civil rights leader, and peace activist, William Sloane Coffin, “May God give you the grace never to sell yourself short, grace to do something big for something good. Grace to remember that the world is too dangerous now for anything but truth and too small for anything but love.” And now may the blessing of God, the source of all goodness, truth, and love inspire you, inspire us all to realize Dr. King’s dream of the beloved community, congressman Lewis’s dream of a just society, president Lincoln’s dream of a more perfect union in this country in our time. Amen.  Bennie Thompson: ( 02:27:31 ) Delegates and distinguished guests, having concluded this evening’s convention program, we will stand in recess until tomorrow evening.

Intro: ( 00:05 ) Justice, strength, liberty.  Intro: ( 00:10 ) Let’s do this!  Intro: ( 00:17 ) We the people of the United States, in order to form a more perfect union, establish justice, ensure domestic tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our prosperity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America.  Intro: ( 01:03 ) We the people call the 48th [inaudible 00:01:07] Democratic Nation Convention to order.  Intro: ( 01:08 ) I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.  Intro: ( 01:15 ) (singing)  Gabriel Salguero: ( 04:04 ) Hello. My name is Gabriel Salguero. Let us pray. Almighty God, we confess that our nation needs you and has always needed you. We pray for your blessing upon all of us, Republican, Independent, and Democrat. As we strive to form perfect union, we pray for your strength, guidance, and wisdom. Lord, we recognize that we are living in challenging times that call us to live up to the highest angel of our national character. As we confront the turbulent winds of a global pandemic, economic uncertainty, and civil discourse, may your gracious hand lead us to the peaceful shores of love, justice and civility.  Gabriel Salguero: ( 04:44 ) Help us, oh Lord, to be ever mindful of the most vulnerable among us, from our golden generation to our youngest children, [foreign language 00:00:04:54] to our veterans, from our health care workers to our schools teachers. Give us a heart of compassion and grace. This nation from Miami to Minneapolis, and from Portland to El Paso, ask you to shepherd us to a hope filled vision that does justice. [foreign language 00:05:14], and walks humbly before you. I pray this in the maximus name of Jesus, amen.  Eva Longoria : ( 05:23 ) Welcome to our convention across America. We had hoped to gather in place, but instead we figured out a safe and responsible way to come together to share ideas and talk abut the future of our country. That’s the kind of leadership we need right now. That’s the kind of leadership that Joe Biden and Kamala Harris will bring to the White House. So during the next four nights, we will gather safely from our homes to listen, to learn, to be inspired to act, to vote and to build that more perfect union. I am honored to be with you this evening.  Eva Longoria : ( 05:58 ) I’m here tonight as a ninth generation Texan, as a daughter of a veteran and a teacher, as a mother, as a voter and as a patriot. I share Joe Biden’s belief that the story of America is one of ordinary people coming together to do extraordinary things, and at our best our country [inaudible 00:06:18]. Tonight, we’re going to begin with the simple kindness we’ve been extending to each other a lot lately. We’re going to check in with folks around the country and ask, “How are you doing?” As many of you know, small businesses employ half of all U.S. workers. Tonight, we have Scott. Scott, you are a small business owner from Swarthmore, Pennsylvania. Small businesses have been hit so hard in this crisis, so many small businesses. How are you doing? How are you managing?  Scott Richardson: ( 06:53 ) Well, it’s been rough. Rough is a nice word to say it. My wife and I, 31 years ago, began our business and quite honestly, over all these years, we’ve faced some adversity and challenges, but to be honest with you, nothing like we are today. We’ve literally had to reinvent our business several times since the beginning of the year, just to stay afloat. Our revenue, for example, is off about 40%. We have half of the employees that we had pre-COVID and our customers are a little scared, our employees are sometimes afraid to come to work because of the COVID. To be honest with you, I’m just frustrated. I don’t understand how we got here. We are the greatest nation in the world. It just seems to me that maybe if we just came together on this one issue alone, maybe as Americans and being united, we can overcome.  Eva Longoria : ( 08:17 ) Yeah. Thank you, Scott, for sharing your story. I’m sure many small business owners feel the same way that you’re feeling now. We wish you the best for your business and, of course, for your family. Now I’d like to turn to Marley Diaz, who is 15 years old from West Orange, New Jersey. She is a literary activist and author, and she is the founder of Thousand Black Girl Books. Marley, so many young people are struggling with the changes due to COVID. How are you doing?  Marley Dias: ( 08:43 ) I’m doing all right. I feel better every day. I feel more hopeful. I thought this was going to be a few weeks at first where I wouldn’t see my friends and I would just stick it out. But obviously as it’s grown longer, I really want to focus on activism and still spreading important messages, given the fact that I can’t go out.  Marley Dias: ( 08:59 ) So I started doing virtual read alouds online, which has been so fun, getting to interact and meet new kids and encourage and promote the joy that we can find in reading and in learning. It’s also super fun to see teenagers like me going on social media and talking about social issues and injustices that they care about because sometimes you don’t have that space in school. So I hope that a year from now, when we get to go back and be safe and be protected, we will still have these conversations and still have a new possibility and a new world.  Eva Longoria : ( 09:29 ) Yes. Thank you so much, Marley. You’re such an inspiration. I don’t think I was doing half of what you’re doing at 15 and I love seeing how brave and creative your generation is to creating change. So thank you. Thank you so much for your work. Let’s check in with Rick. Rick, you are a farmer from Volant, Pennsylvania. Your farm has been in your family for generations. What have the trade wars and the pandemic done to your family’s life work?  Rick Telesz: ( 09:59 ) Well, first of all, I’d like to offer the Trump family our condolences for his loss. Getting back to the business side of it, the trade war was … it was a real stressful and truly a devastating effect on the farm. Most probably what people can relate to mostly in agriculture is the soybean [inaudible 00:10:19], and then whenever you compound the effects of the COVID-19 virus, nobody could have prevented that. It’s a shame our leadership misinforms people like myself in the country on what was coming down the road. My biggest concern is that if these trends continue with this type of leadership, I will be the last generation farming this farm.  Eva Longoria : ( 10:47 ) Yeah. It’s a scary thought, and I’m sure a lot of farmers feel the same way.  Rick Telesz: ( 10:53 ) I don’t have the answers, but past experiences, if something doesn’t work for you, it’s time for change. That’s why I’m supporting Joe Biden all the way.  Eva Longoria : ( 11:04 ) Well, thank you so much. Rick, I couldn’t agree with you more. We need meaningful change and leadership that will support family farms like yours, so we wish you the best. Thank you for sharing your story. Finally, let’s hear from Michelle, from my home state of Texas. Michelle, you are a school nurse and a mother in El Paso. How are you preparing for the new school year?  Michelle Beebe: ( 11:27 ) Hi Eva. Well, we’ve already started school, but it is a little challenging because every day something seems to change. We start one way one day and we have to change it the next day. I know that right now it’s kind of sad not to see the kiddos when we’re back, but I know that that will change. We’re going to have to adapt and persevere. But honestly, right now, all I can think about is keeping my kiddo safe. I know back in March, we had them at home and we were doing okay, but now they’re wanting us to them back to school and it’s a little scary with all the uprise and COVID cases.  Michelle Beebe: ( 11:58 ) So I just want to say that I am committed to take care of my family, my students, and all my staff at my school. I will do whatever it takes to ensure that we are all ready to go back to school, safe and healthy. I know that I am optimistic to move forward with our life and Joe Biden will be the one to take us there. I just want to say for everyone to please remember to wash their hands and wear their mask because we’re all in this together.  Eva Longoria : ( 12:26 ) Thank you, Michelle. I think there’s nothing more difficult for us as moms than to see our children suffer, and so I think you’re doing a great job of guiding them through this very difficult time, and thank you for the work you do as a nurse. It’s truly heroic. I really enjoy talking to all of you. I think I have one last question. Do you believe that change is coming? Do you believe that better days are ahead?  Scott Richardson: ( 12:51 ) Yes.  Marley Dias: ( 12:51 ) Yes.  Rick Telesz: ( 12:51 ) Yes.  Michelle Beebe: ( 12:51 ) Yes.  Eva Longoria : ( 12:54 ) Well, thank you for taking the time to speak with us and sharing your thoughts. You are the we in “We, the people,” and you are who this convention is about.  Joe Biden: ( 13:05 ) … in 1776, the declaration of independence. We hold these truths to be self evident. These words are the basis for the American creed, equality, equity, fairness, decency. America didn’t live up to that promise for most of the people at the time, the people of color, for women, but we were born of an idea that every single solitary person given half a chance, no matter where they’re from, given half a chance, there’s not a single thing they cannot do if they work at it. Nothing’s beyond their capacity.  Eva Longoria : ( 13:43 ) We had hoped to have our convention in the city of festivals, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, this year. Of course, we’re not able to do that, but we’ll be hearing from several of Wisconsin’s leaders throughout this convention, starting with Congresswoman Gwen Moore.  Gwen Moore: ( 14:03 ) Hi, I’m Gwen Moore and it’s my honor to represent Milwaukee in Congress and to kick off the 2020 democratic convention. Oh, I sure wish you all were here in the city of Milwaukee, which takes its name from the languages of the first peoples interpreted as good land and gathering place by the waters. This is a city where blood was shed for labor rights, where a fugitive slave was freed from prison, where women’s right to vote was first ratified. But today, we gather virtually however. We gather unified in spirit, unified in our values and purpose to heal divisions and together move the nation confidently into a prosperous inclusive future.  Gwen Moore: ( 14:53 ) What better way to gather that all across America to nominate my beloved friend, Joe Biden, to be 46 president of the United States of America with my VIP, VP nominee, sister, Kamala Harris by his side. Tonight, we are gathered to reclaim the soul of America. So if you’re ready to come together, America, text “join” 30330. Thank you. I love you all and God bless you.  Joe Biden: ( 18:13 ) We have to let them know who we are, what we stand for. We choose hope over fear, truth over lies, and yes, unity over division. It’s time for us to lift our heads up, open our hearts and remember who we are. We are the United States of America. I mean it. There’s not a single thing we cannot do if we do it together.  Derrick Johnson: ( 18:38 ) The idea of us calling ourselves the United States of America feels like it’s pretty wrong right now. Fairly ashamed to say it, but I’m one of many who voted for the current president, Donald Trump. I challenge you to think back to what made you vote for Donald Trump in 2016. I know I sure have. I’ve registered as a Democrat for the first time in my life. I’m doing that because I think this election is bigger than any political party. What I think in light of current events, if nothing else, we need more than anything is a proven leader. Donald Trump’s rhetoric is … it’s divisive, it’s dangerous. It’s also really difficult to vote for someone who essentially has zero platform right now, four months out from the election. Joe Biden on the other hand has a very detailed plan, things like unity, education, climate preservation, racial inequality, and even healthcare. We have a chance right now to look ourselves in the mirror and go vote for a proven leader with a history of caring about others and truly putting all Americans first.  Eva Longoria : ( 20:21 ) Our nation is facing a lot right now and over the next four nights, we’re going to cover it all. But tonight we’re going to talk about three specific crises we face; the pandemic, an economic downturn and an ongoing systemic racial injustice. But we’re not just going to focus on what’s wrong. We’re going to talk about how to make it right. When peaceful protesters were teargassed across from the White House, our next speaker stood up, stood strong and turned that place into the Black Lives Matter Plaza in their honor. Please welcome Mayor Muriel Bowser.  Muriel Bowser: ( 21:00 ) Hello, I’m Muriel Bowser, mayor of Washington, DC. The story of our nation’s capital is a story of reckoning. It was here that John Lewis and Dr. King spoke on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial. It was here that millions of women and men flooded the streets for the women’s march. It was here that, just weeks ago, Americans donned face masks and safely and peacefully protested the death of George Floyd. But while we were peacefully protesting, Donald Trump was plotting. He stood in front of one of our most treasured houses of worship and held a Bible for a photo op. He sent troops in camouflage into our streets. He sent tear gas into the air and federal helicopters too.  Muriel Bowser: ( 21:42 ) I knew if he did this to DC, he would do it to your city or your town, and that’s when I said enough. I said enough for every black and brown American who has experienced injustice, enough for every American who believes in justice. But I said enough for another reason too. I have a two year old daughter and I want her to grow up in an America where she’s not scared to walk to the store, an America where she’s safe behind the doors of her own home, an America where the president doesn’t fan the flames of racism and looks out for all of us.  Muriel Bowser: ( 22:15 ) So I created Black Lives Matter Plaza right behind me as the place where we could come together to say enough. And by coming together this November to elect Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, we will say next, because we can’t just paint those words behind me. We can’t just say those words. We have to live those words. We have to undo the laws and systems that have codified racism for far too long. But we have to do something too. Each and every one of us, challenge our own biases. If we see something, do something. Together, we can turn this reckoning into a reimagining of a nation where we, the people means all the people. There were a few people who stood on this very balcony as thousands of people peacefully protested in this city. One was our next vice president, my sister, Kamala Harris. The others were members of George Floyd’s family, who I’m honored to introduce now.  Philonise Floyd: ( 23:21 ) My brother George was selfless. He always made sacrifices for his family, friends and even complete strangers. George had a given spirit, a spirit that has shown up on streets around our nation and around the world. People of all races, all ages, all genders, all backgrounds, peacefully protesting in the name of love and unity. It’s a fitting legacy for our brother, but George should be alive today. Brianna Taylor should be alive today. Ahmaud Arbery should be alive today. Eric Garner should be alive today. Stefan Clark, Tatiana Jefferson, Sandra Bland. They should all be alive today. So it’s up to us to carry on the fight for justice. Our actions will be their legacies. We must always find ourselves in what John Lewis called good trouble for the names we do not know, the faces we’ll never see, those who can’t mourn because their murders didn’t go viral. Please join me in a moment of silence to honor George and the many other souls we lost to hate and injustice. And when this moment is, let’s make sure we never stopped saying their names.  Leon Bridges: ( 24:43 ) (singing)  Eva Longoria : ( 28:34 ) Thank you, Leon Bridges, who’s song Sweeter featured Terrace Martin, a song written after George Floyd’s murder. You know, we have to ask ourselves, how do we, the people, take the protest and turn them into progress? How do we take the changes we’re seeing in the hearts and minds of people and translate it into real and lasting change in people’s lives? We need to address the economic inequalities that this virus has exposed and worsened, and we need to solve the testing and healthcare disparities that have led to people of color dying from COVID at higher rates than white people, and we need to make it easier for Americans to vote. We have a lot to do and to do this, we need community action, we need Congress that can have power to do it, and we need a president who understands that this is the moment.  Joe Biden: ( 29:28 ) The moment has come for our nation to deal with systemic racism, to deal with the growing economic inequity that exists in our nation, to deal with the denial of the promise of this nation made to so many. I’ve said from the outset of this election that we’re in the battle for the soul of this nation. We are in the battle for the soul of this nation. What we believe, and maybe most importantly, who we want to be, it’s all at stake. That’s truer today than it’s ever been, at least in my lifetime. It’s this urgency, it’s in this urgency, we can find a path forward.  Joe Biden: ( 30:18 ) Hey everybody, how are you? Thanks for doing this. [crosstalk 00:00:30:22]. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Jamira, tell the rest of the folks a little about your background.  Jamira Burley: ( 30:28 ) I started doing activism when I was 15. It was at the intersection of knowing both the perpetrator and a victim. My brother Andre was shot and killed in Philadelphia and it made me realize that I had a responsibility, almost a collective responsibility, to ensure that that didn’t happen to other young people. I think that’s what’s missing in America right now, is our collective responsibility to each other and to realize that the person down the street or around the corner, even across the country, that we have a responsibility to ensure that we’re making sure that they’re safe, they have access to education, and that in all were created in a world in which their differences are celebrated as well as protected under the law.  Joe Biden: ( 31:09 ) Mayor, how are you prioritizing the many things you have to do, as we try to tackle, in a way that we haven’t before, systemic racism in the city?  Lori Lightfoot: ( 31:18 ) It really is about economic empowerment because if people are lifted out of poverty and they are given an opportunity to feel a stake in their own future, that goes a long way. We’re also challenging all kinds of institutions from corporations to community based organizations to think about what they can do better to end systemic racism and make sure that we’re uplifting the quality of life in communities, but also the voices of people that traditionally don’t have a seat at the table.  Joe Biden: ( 31:54 ) President’s talking about defunding the post office and mail and voting. What do you think we should be doing, Mr. President?  Derrick Johnson: ( 32:01 ) Well, first of all, we have to change the public discourse around voting. It should be seen as a democratic thing to do, the most patriotic thing we can do and not a partisan exercise. Secondly, how do we open up access to voting so we could address some of the systemic problems? Not only should we reauthorize the voting rights act, but we have to go farther. Most importantly, voting should be seen as a constitutional right that’s guaranteed, and with that level of sight, that all citizens can be assured that they can have unfettered access without being suppressed.  Art Acevedo: ( 32:42 ) This is a watershed moment and we can’t lose this moment. We have got to have action at the national level. We have got to have congressional action. We cannot have 18,000 police departments, and in 2020, have police departments still allowing the use of a knee on a man’s neck in George Floyd. A lot of us were shocked and I think what gives me hope-  Art Acevedo: ( 33:03 ) A lot of us were shocked. And I think what gives me hope is that police officers were shocked, police officers have spoken out. And we’re hopeful that we’ll have some national standards as it relates to policing, use of force, a national database, abolishment of a prohibition on a national standard in terms of choke holds, and that we actually used the death of George Floyd’s and others to actually make policing, take it to the next level, which is what everyone wants, including all the good cops that are out there, that thankfully there are more of them than there are bad cops.  Joe Biden: ( 33:35 ) Most cops are good, but the fact is the bad ones have to be identified and prosecuted and out, period. Gwen, how are you doing?  Gwen Carr: ( 33:46 ) Oh, well, I’m doing pretty well, as well as can be expected.  Joe Biden: ( 33:52 ) I’m sure that the words of George Floyd, “I can’t breathe,” were not new to you, and they echo in your mind every single day. It’s six years ago when your son died, but we can’t let this keep happening. What do you think the next thing we have to do, Gwen?  Gwen Carr: ( 34:09 ) Well, first of all, I know when my son was murdered, there was a big uprising, but then it settled down. We can’t let things settle down. We have to go to the politicians and we have to hold their feet to the fire, because otherwise the big uprising is not going to mean a lot. So I’m just asking that if you become the president, that you make sure that we get national law as well as state and local law, especially when it comes to police brutality, because that has been a age old problem.  Joe Biden: ( 34:50 ) Well, I may be kidding myself, but I think the people are ready. I think people are ready, we just got to keep pushing. We can’t let up. But thank you for what you’re doing. I really appreciate it. Thanks for joining me.  Gwen Carr: ( 35:01 ) Thank you.  Joe Biden: ( 35:03 ) Bye bye. Thank you.  Anton G.: ( 35:10 ) Racism structurally, individually and systematically is real.  Jeanna H.: ( 35:15 ) Black, brown, no matter what you look like, you should not ever be fearful of your life due to the color of your skin.  Dekevius A.: ( 35:22 ) What I want to see in the next president of the United States is someone who’s fair, who believes in equal justice under the law. I want him to lead us through this revolution that we’re experiencing right now.  Sina: ( 35:35 ) Joe Biden is a healer and he’s a unifier. He will fight for the Black Lives Matter movement.  Rhonda C.: ( 35:40 ) Undo, remove, tear down the remnants of structural and systematic racism in this country.  Joseph M.: ( 35:47 ) The systemic injustices that exist, things that our nation has overlooked, that need to be addressed.  Jeanna H.: ( 35:53 ) We need to stand on our platform and introduce legislation that makes this platform felt from coast to coast.  Victor S.: ( 36:00 ) I know that Joe Biden is the person to restore the values that we hold so near and dear to our hearts.  Dekevius A.: ( 36:04 ) I have a 10 year old son. I want to make sure that there is a world that’s left better for him.  Jim Clyburn: ( 36:22 ) Good evening. I’m Congressman, Jim Clyburn, here in historic-  Speaker 1: ( 36:26 ) Standby.  Jim Clyburn: ( 36:29 ) Good evening. I’m Congressman Jim Clyburn, here in historic Charleston, South Carolina. Six months ago, I stood not far from here and endorsed Joe Biden to be our 46th president. It was a decision I made with my feet firmly planted in this community, this community, where 80% of African Americans in this country can claim an ancestor, who arrived on these shows in bondage, a few blocks from here over at Gadsden’s Wharf. This community that is still healing from the wounds we received when a white supremacist entered Emanuel AME church, and murdered nine black parishioners as they studied the Bible together.  Jim Clyburn: ( 37:14 ) The ground beneath our feet is seated with pain that is both old and new. But from that soil, we always find a way to grow together. Earlier this summer, the city of Charleston removed a statue, honoring John C. Calhoun, an honored advocate of slavery. And construction is underway on the International African American museum at Gadsden’s Wharf. Much like the country as a whole, we are stepping out from the shadows of our past and beginning to lay the groundwork for a more just future. It won’t be easy. We can only succeed if we move forward together. So we will need a president who sees unifying people as a requirement of the job, a president who understands the true meaning of community and how to build it through trust and humility.  Jim Clyburn: ( 38:12 ) And with so many families experiencing loss in this pandemic, lost jobs, lost loved ones and lost confidence in the president to keep us safe, we need a president who understands both profound loss and what it takes to bounce back. But more important than his first hand experience with loss and hardship, is his ability to translate that perspective into policy and solutions, and prioritize hardworking people and persistent poverty counties over partisan politics or personal gain. That’s why I stand with Joe. And while he will always be an adopted son of South Carolina, Joe Biden is as good a man as he is a leader. I have said before and wish to reiterate tonight, we know Joe, but more importantly, Joe knows us.  Kevin Penn: ( 39:17 ) Hi, I’m Kevin. I do a lot of things in life, but the thing I’m most proud of is I am a TAPS military mentor. And that’s how I spend the majority of my time, post Marine Corps. Building memories like the ones we built together is the single best thing I do with my time. Thank you for allowing me to be part of your lives and sharing the journeys for the past decade. We’ve got about 500 kids and family members and mentors and we’re all packed into this very large ballroom. And all of a sudden the back door opens up and in walks Joe Biden. I had almost an out of body experience because he surprised us all.  Kevin Penn: ( 39:55 ) I like to think I’m decent at reading people from my time in the Marine Corps, my time as an Intel officer and my time as a drill instructor, my time studying psychology. He was being real. I mean, you can’t fake that kind of a smile. He was genuinely happy to see these kids and to spend time with them. It’s easy to lose faith in humanity, especially today, there’s a lot of polarization. Leaves a lot of room for a lot of hope. It’s hard to articulate real character when you see it. Policies are great and we need sound policies as well, which he also has those cause he’s got the CHOPs, right? But it’s almost like none of that matters if you don’t have the character.  Kevin Penn: ( 40:33 ) This is a very unprecedented and challenging time that requires an unprecedented and courageous leader. We need someone with the courage to do what’s necessary and what’s right to strive towards a more perfect union, that’s Joe Biden. I know Joe, because he cares about everybody else before himself.  Eva Longoria : ( 40:56 ) You know what else Joe knows? Joe knows about pandemics. In 2014, he helped stop the spread of Ebola and brought the world together to keep it contained. And after that success, knowing this would happen again, vice president Biden and president Obama assembled a pandemic playbook to make sure that America was prepared and protected. The Trump administration disbanded the pandemic response team that was given to them. Americans have died and lost their livelihoods because of it. We, the people deserve a president who believes in science, that recognizes the threat of COVID, who has a plan to get us through it, and that is Joe Biden.  Eva Longoria : ( 41:42 ) We’re grateful that across the country, there are responsible leaders who are stepping up. One of them provided clear direction and memorable power points, New York’s governor, Andrew lease.  Andrew Cuomo: ( 41:58 ) Hello, today is Monday, day 170. New Yorkers were ground zero for the COVID virus and have gone from one of the highest infection rates on the globe to one of the lowest. We climbed the impossible mountain, and right now we are on the other side. We did it with the kindness and assistance of so many. New Yorkers want to thank everyone who came to our aid, 30,000 Americans who volunteered to come here to help in our hour of need. Your love gave us the strength to carry on. We went through hell, but we’ve learned much. We know that our problems go beyond the COVID virus. COVID is the symptom, not the illness. Our nation is in crisis. And in many ways, COVID is just a metaphor. A virus attacks when the body is weak and when it cannot defend itself.  Andrew Cuomo: ( 42:49 ) Over these past few years, America’s body politics has been weakened. The divisions have been growing deeper, the antisemitism, the anti-Latino, the anti-immigrant fervor, the racism in Charlottesville, where the KKK didn’t even bother to wear their hoods, and in Minnesota where the life was squeezed from Mr. Floyd. Only a strong body can fight off the virus, and America’s divisions weakened it. Donald Trump didn’t create the initial division. The division created Trump, he only made it worse. Our collective strength is exercised through government. It is in effect, our immune system and our current federal government is dysfunctional and then competent. It couldn’t fight off the virus. In fact, it didn’t even see it coming. The European virus infected the Northeast while the White House was still fixated on China. The virus had been attacking us for months before they even knew it was here. We saw the failure of a government that tried to deny the virus then tried to ignore it, and then try to politicize it. The failed federal government that watched New York get ambushed by their negligence and then watched New York suffer, but all through it learned absolutely nothing.  Andrew Cuomo: ( 44:09 ) So today, six months after it began, the nation is still unprepared. And we now face a second threat, but this time not from mother nature, this is a manmade threat by our own negligence. We now see the virus ricocheting across the country from one state to another. Today, we trail the world in defeating COVID. We have over 5 million cases. Americans learned a critical lesson, how vulnerable we are when we are divided and how many lives can be lost when our government is incompetent. But we learned something else, my friends. We saw the negative, but we also saw the positive.  Andrew Cuomo: ( 44:54 ) As they prove their way failed, we proved that our way succeeded, that America can still rise to the occasion. We can put our differences aside and find commonality. Government can tell the truth and can build trust. We can judge by content of character, rather than color of skin. We can care for one another, that Americans can work together and forge community and a competent government, that of course we will wear masks because we are smart, and because I care about you and because you care about me. Of course we will socially distance, because staying away shows how close we actually are.  Andrew Cuomo: ( 45:35 ) Yes, we will set up testing and tracing and do whatever we need to do to mobilize, to win this battle because we are America. We win wars and we are the greatest country on the globe. And for all the pain and all the tears, our way worked, and it was beautiful. We showed that our better angels are strong and that Americans will rise to their call. We saw that even at the end of the day, even if it is a long day, that love wins. Americans’ eyes have been opened. And we have seen in this crisis, the truth that government matters and leadership matters, and it determines whether we thrive and grow or whether we live or die.  Andrew Cuomo: ( 46:21 ) Now, we need a leader as good as our people, a leader who appeals to the best within us, not the worst, a leader who can unify, not divide, a leader who can bring us up, not tear us down. I know that man, I’ve worked with that man. I’ve seen his talent. I’ve seen his strength. I’ve seen his pain and I’ve seen his heart. That man is Joe Biden. Joe Biden is what I call America tough, tough in the best way. Tough that is smart, united, disciplined and loving. Joe Biden can restore the soul of America, and that’s exactly what our country needs today. Thank you.  Speaker 2: ( 47:11 ) And now, we’ll hear from Kristin Urquiza.  Kristin Urquiza: ( 47:15 ) Hi, I’m Kristin Urquiza. I’m one of the many who has lost a loved one to COVID. My dad, Mark Anthony Urquiza should be here today, but he isn’t. He had faith in Donald Trump. He voted for him, listened to him, believed him and his mouthpieces when they said that coronavirus was under control and going to disappear, that it was okay to end social distancing rules before it was safe, and that if you had no underlying health conditions, you’d probably be fine. So in late May, after the stay at home order was lifted in Arizona, my dad went to a karaoke bar with his friends. A few weeks later, he was put on a ventilator and after five agonizing days, he died alone in the ICU with a nurse holding his hand.  Kristin Urquiza: ( 48:09 ) My dad was a healthy 65 year old. His only preexisting condition was trusting Donald Trump, and for that, he paid with his life. I am not alone. Once I told my story, a lot of people reached out to me to share theirs. They asked me to help them keep their communities safe, especially communities of color, which have been disproportionately affected. They asked me, a normal person to help because Donald Trump won’t. The coronavirus has made it clear that there are two Americas, the America that Donald Trump lives in, and the America that my father died in.  Kristin Urquiza: ( 48:53 ) Enough is enough. Donald Trump may not have caused the coronavirus, but his dishonesty and his irresponsible actions made it so much worse. We need a leader who has a national, coordinated, data driven response to stop this pandemic from claiming more lives and to safely reopen the country. We need a leader who will step in on day one and do his job, to care. One of the last things that my father said to me was that he felt betrayed by the likes of Donald Trump. And so when I cast my vote for Joe Biden, I will do it for my dad.  Eva Longoria : ( 49:38 ) Thank you, Kristin, for sharing your story. Our nation grieves for your father and all those we’ve lost to this virus. It’s a toll that hasn’t fallen equally on us. People of color have been disproportionately affected, dying at greater rates than white Americans. But we can honor all of those we’ve lost by giving Joe Biden and Kamala Harris the opportunity to put in place a real national plan that tests and tracks, that makes sure that access to a vaccine will be fair and turns the full power of our government toward making sure we have the supplies and technology and people, scientists and public health officials and contact tracers, we need to stop this.  Eva Longoria : ( 50:21 ) So right now, let’s hear from a champion for our frontline workers, who also happens to be an Olympic champion and a World Cup champion, Megan Rapinoe.  Megan Rapinoe: ( 50:34 ) Hi, everybody. My name is Megan Rapinoe and I have the distinct honor today to host a conversation with four of our frontline workers here in America, we should rename them heroes, absolutely. Trung Lee, can you tell us a little bit about how you’re doing during this time?  Trung Lee: ( 50:53 ) So early on when the government was still trying to figure out proper protocols to protect frontline workers, I had unfortunately contracted COVID through patient contact and was isolated by myself for two weeks. So total isolation, no contact. Once I recovered luckily, I went back to the front lines to continue to take care of the sick. And what got me originally was watching people die alone. There were no visitors allowed, everyone was totally isolated, and I knew how that felt because for two weeks, that was me, not knowing if you were going to wake up, not knowing if you were going to make it, who you were going to talk to, if you can say goodbye.  Trung Lee: ( 51:35 ) This was people’s moms, dads, brothers, sisters, sons, daughters, all dying alone. And we know there’s a round two coming and mentally, physically, emotionally, I don’t know how many of us on the front lines are going to survive that second round.  Megan Rapinoe: ( 51:52 ) Dr. Bradley, what effects are you seeing inside your hospital doors of the inaction of the Trump administration when it comes to this COVID response?  Dr. Bradley Dreifuss: ( 52:01 ) It’s heavy. I mean, I’ve left the emergency department in tears, and so have a lot of my colleagues. People are exhausted and we’re looking at the tsunami that’s coming this winter with COVID and influenza. And I think all of us are wondering how is our system not going to just collapse? Because if we’re not there when people come with their broken arms or they come with their heart attacks and strokes and their appendicitis, we’re not going to be there.  Megan Rapinoe: ( 52:27 ) What were you seeing on the front lines, in those very early days that you knew it wasn’t going to magically disappear? Did you think it was a hoax then?  Aldo Martinez: ( 52:34 ) Oh, absolutely we knew that this was not a hoax. We were certain of it. All of us knew from experience back in 2009, with the swine flu, we knew what a pandemic would look like. We knew that we needed to have the tools and the resources and the plans in place, but then we have the ineptitude and the lack of leadership from this administration. I’ve seen the worst of the worst. Not only have I answered thousands of calls of people that are sick, but people that are dying.  Megan Rapinoe: ( 53:07 ) Michelle, tell us a little bit about how it’s been for you on the front lines, what your specific role is.  Michelle Boyle: ( 53:14 ) As a union nurse, I’ve been primarily more in the forefront on advocating that our healthcare workers and our patients get the support and the PPE that they need. 10 years ago, I responded to the disaster in Haiti. We were working in a tent hospital after the earthquake, but the first time that I ever feared for my life and my family’s walking into work was in my own country. We have the money, we have the means, we have the resources in this country. We are deeply lacking leadership and somebody who cares. Trump has made it perfectly clear how he feels, and we need a president who cares, that’s Joe Biden.  Megan Rapinoe: ( 54:07 ) Dr. Bradley Dreiffus, Aldo Martinez, Michelle Boyle and Trung Lee, I can’t thank you enough. The American people are forever indebted to you, to your work and your sacrifice, and just you showing up every single day and giving everything you have. And thank you again for all of the work you do on the front line. There’s no way we could ever repay you. So thank you very much.  Terry: ( 54:37 ) Millions of people and veterans and senior citizens rely on the postal system for prescription medicines, for their checks.  Jeffrey: ( 54:46 ) Having the postal service to deliver about the suspicious became even more confronting when the COVID-19 virus hit us here in the United States.  Victoria: ( 54:55 ) However, now with Donald Trump in office and his attempts to undermine the United States Postal Service, we are extremely concerned.  Jeffrey: ( 55:06 ) This administration’s decision not to provide the necessary funding to the United States Postal Service is appalling.  Elizabeth: ( 55:13 ) I was diagnosed with multiple myeloma. Voting by mail is our only realistic option.  Rhoda: ( 55:21 ) In no way do I want my 11 grandchildren to grow up in a world where this kind of suppression exists.  Sara Gideon: ( 55:39 ) I’m Sara Gideon and I’m running to represent Maine in the US Senate. Every day I see the caring and resilient spirit that will get us through this crisis. Americans are looking out for one another. It’s time we had leadership in Washington that did the same. With Joe Biden in the White House and a democratic Senate, I know we can build back our economy and our communities even stronger. But tonight, I am here to welcome someone who has strong ties to our state and is here in Maine with me. She is reminding all of us to keep fighting through. With her song that she’s performing, Back in My Body, please help me welcome someone who’s an inspiration to all of us and one of my favorite artists, Maggie Rogers.  Maggie Rogers: ( 56:24 ) (singing).  Rebekah O.: ( 59:24 ) When the COVID-19 pandemic hit, all I could think about were my students and their families.  Annette: ( 59:29 ) All the suffering and pain and death that really didn’t have to be this way.  George C.: ( 59:35 ) If we had leadership in place that would have taken this pandemic seriously in the beginning, we would not be in a situation we are in now.  Annette: ( 59:42 ) We still, at this time, don’t have the necessary PPE.  Cesar A.: ( 59:48 ) And I am very worried about what is in front of us. We’re going to have classrooms that maybe have not been sanitized properly because we don’t have the money for that kind of equipment. We’re going to have classrooms packed with students. And so the virus is going to be hard to contain. So this is very dangerous for the safety of our kids.  George C.: ( 01:00:06 ) I hope that the new leadership takes American lives seriously.  Mitzi D.: ( 01:00:10 ) I know Joe Biden understands that the only way to keep people safe and our economy strong is to follow the recommendations of doctors. And we’re going to do everything we can to get Joe Biden elected.  Gretchen Whitmer: ( 01:00:31 ) Hello, America, I’m Governor Gretchen Whitmer, or as Donald Trump calls me, that woman from Michigan. Tonight, I’m here at UAW local, 6:52 in Lansing, Michigan. Auto workers in this union and across our state could have lost their jobs if not for Barack Obama and Joe Biden. In 2009, the Obama Biden administration inherited the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression, the auto industry on the brink of collapse, a million jobs at stake. But president Obama and vice president Biden didn’t waste time blaming anyone else or shirking their responsibility, they got to work. They brought together union members, companies and lawmakers on both sides of the aisle, and they saved the auto industry.  Gretchen Whitmer: ( 01:01:34 ) And wouldn’t you know, just a few months ago, as our nation began battling COVID-19, auto workers across Michigan sprang into action. They started making protective equipment for doctors and nurses on the front lines. Let me break it down. President Obama and vice president Biden saved these auto workers’ livelihoods, then these workers did their part to save American lives. That’s the story of this great nation. Action begets action, progress begets progress. And when we work together, we can accomplish anything. After all, democracy is a team sport, especially now. It’s crucial that we rally together to fight this virus and build our economy back better.  Gretchen Whitmer: ( 01:02:27 ) From the jump, we took this pandemic seriously in Michigan. We listened to medical experts, we planned. And with a lot of work from the auto workers and too little help from the White House, we executed our plan. We saved thousands of lives. Just imagine if we had a national strategy so everyone who needs a test gets one for free, so everyone has access to a safe vaccine, so our kids and educators have the resources they need to safely get back to school. With Joe Biden and Kamala Harris in the white house, we will. Joe Biden and Kamala Harris will lead by example. It’ll be science, not politics or ego that will drive their decisions. They know the health of our people goes hand in hand with the strength of our economy. They know action begets action.  Gretchen Whitmer: ( 01:03:22 ) Over the past few months, we’ve learned what’s essential, rising to the challenge, not denying it. We’ve learned who is essential too, not just the wealthiest among us, not a president who fights his fellow Americans rather than fight the virus that’s killing us and our economy. It’s the people who put their own health at risk to care for the rest of us, they are the MVPs. The nurses and the doctors, the utility workers, truck drivers and grocery clerks, the childcare workers, the parents, the teachers, the mail carriers and the auto workers. So many of these essential workers have lost their lives to COVID. Nearly 1,000 healthcare workers, more than 170,000 people across America, including a five year old girl named Skylar from Detroit, whose mom is a police officer and dad is a firefighter.  Gretchen Whitmer: ( 01:04:24 ) Generation after generation, our nation has been defined by what we do or what we fail to do. So for Skylar, for her parents and in the memory of all those we’ve lost, let us act, let us heal as one nation. Let us find strength to do the work.  Eva Longoria : ( 01:05:51 ) We, the people means all the people, even those with whom we might not agree. Even those, we might not expect to see at a democratic convention. But Joe Biden is a guy who has earned the respect-  Eva Longoria : ( 01:06:03 ) … convention. But Joe Biden is a guy who has earned the respect he commands across the world and across the aisle. The stakes in this election call for that kind of leadership, we have to think about more than one party. We have to think about the very core of our democracy. And that’s why you’re about to hear from some unexpected voices.  Governor Christine Todd Whitman: ( 01:06:23 ) I’m Governor Christine Todd Whitman. What am I doing here? I’m a lifelong Republican. My parents were introduced at the Republican National Convention by their parents, that’s how far back it goes. But this isn’t about a Republican or Democrat. It’s about a person. A person decent enough, stable enough, strong enough to get our economy back on track. A person who can work with everyone, Democrats and Republicans to get things done. Donald Trump isn’t that person, Joe Biden is.  Meg Whitman: ( 01:06:53 ) I’m Meg Whitman. I’m a longtime Republican and a longtime CEO. And let me tell you, Donald Trump has no clue how to run a business, let alone an economy. Joe Biden on the other hand, has a plan that will strengthen our economy for working people and small business owners. For me, the choice is simple. I’m with Joe.  Susan Molinari: ( 01:07:13 ) Hi, I’m Susan Molinari. I’m a former Republican member of Congress from New York City, and I’ve known Donald Trump for most of my political career. So disappointing and lately, so disturbing. Now, I’ve also gotten to know and work with Joe Biden on issues related to women that are so important to all of us, women in business violence against women. That’s why I’m so proud to call him my friend, and honored to join and supporting his candidacy for president. He’s a really good man and he’s exactly what this nation needs at this time. Now I’m delighted and honored to introduce a former colleague of mine, the former Congressman from Ohio, the former Governor of Ohio, John Kasich.  John Kasich: ( 01:07:55 ) America is at a crossroads. Sometimes elections represent a real choice, a choice we make as individuals and as a nation about which path we want to take when we’ve come to challenging times, America is at that crossroads today. The stakes in this election are greater than any in modern times. Many of us have been deeply concerned about the current path we’ve been following for the past four years. It’s a path that’s led to division, dysfunction, irresponsibility, and growing vitriol between our citizens. Continuing to follow that path will have terrible consequences for America’s soul because we’re being taken down the wrong road by a president who has pitted one against the other. He’s unlike all of our best leaders before him who worked to unite us, to bridge our differences, and lead us to a united America. I’m a lifelong Republican, but that attachment holds second place to my responsibility to my country.  John Kasich: ( 01:08:57 ) That’s why I’ve chosen to appear at this convention. In normal times, something like this would probably never happen, but these are not normal times. I’m proud of my Republican heritage. It’s the party of Lincoln who reflected its founding principles of unity and a higher purpose. But what I have witnessed these past four years belies those principles. Many of us can’t imagine four more years going down this path. And that’s why I’m asking you to join with me in choosing a better way forward. I believe the best of America lies ahead, but only when we rediscovered our shared belief in the United States of America for our children’s future, which can be bright, hopeful, and inspired if we choose to make it so. I’ve known Joe Biden for 30 years. I know his story of profound grief that has so deeply affected his character. I know Joe is a good man, a man of faith, a unifier, someone who understands the hopes and dreams of the common man and the common woman, a man who can help us to see the humanity in each other.  John Kasich: ( 01:10:11 ) He knows that the path to a restored and rejuvenated America lies in respect and unity and a common purpose for everyone. Yes, there are areas where Joe and I absolutely disagree, but that’s okay because that’s America. Because whatever our differences, we respect one another as human beings, each of us searching for justice and for purpose. We can all see what’s going on in our country today and all the questions that are facing us, and no one person or a party has all the answers. But what we do know is that we can do better than what we’ve been seeing today, for sure. And I know that Joe Biden with his experience and his wisdom and his decency, can bring us together to help us find that better way. I’m sure there are Republicans and independents who couldn’t imagine crossing over to support a Democrat. They fear Joe may turn sharp, left and leave them behind. I don’t believe that because I know the measure of the man. He’s reasonable, faithful, respectful, and no one pushes Joe around. Joe Biden is a man for our times, times that call for all of us to take off our partisan hats and put our nation first for ourselves, and of course for our children. When America chooses the right path and pulls together, like we’ve done so many times before. Yeah, we can dream big dreams and we can see the top of the mountain as a United States of America with a soul that is a beacon of freedom to the entire world. [singing 01:11:50]  Terry Williams: ( 01:11:53 ) Hello. My name is Terry Williams and I’ve been a Republican for all of my adult life.  Donna N.: ( 01:11:57 ) A lifelong Republican-  Alan P.: ( 01:11:58 ) Republican.  Garry: ( 01:11:59 ) A lifelong Republican.  Michael: ( 01:12:00 ) I’ve been a longstanding Republican. And I’m telling ya, you got to vote for Joe Biden.  Debra: ( 01:12:06 ) I have voted for and campaigned for Republicans since the Reagan years, but I won’t be voting for Donald Trump in November.  Garry: ( 01:12:12 ) I’m supporting Joe Biden for president.  Donna N.: ( 01:12:14 ) We need a positive leader. Someone who can work with both sides, Republicans and the Democrats.  Michael: ( 01:12:22 ) I don’t think we can deal with the type of person we have in the White House any longer.  Terry Williams: ( 01:12:26 ) Vote America. That’s the only way to get out of this. And Joe Biden is just the person to ensure we get our lives back to normal.  Garry: ( 01:12:34 ) Joe Biden is a decent man with a long history of public service to America.  Debra: ( 01:12:38 ) He will restore order and integrity to the executive branch.  Alan P.: ( 01:12:42 ) I would strongly encourage all of us to come together.  Garry: ( 01:12:45 ) And hopefully return our country’s political discourse back to some measure of normalcy and decency.  Michael: ( 01:12:51 ) I’m sure, I’m absolutely sure he’s going to help us bring this country together once again. [Singing 01:12:58]  Speaker 3: ( 01:13:06 ) And now from Alabama, Senator Doug Jones.  Senator Doug Jones: ( 01:13:10 ) I’m Senator Doug Jones from the great state of Alabama. Growing up in the South meant growing up in the midst of stark divisions, but it was here in Alabama where Rosa Parks helped ignite a movement by refusing to give up her seat on a bus, where freedom riders of different races came together in pursuit of equality, and it was here in Alabama where John Lewis marched across a bridge toward freedom. From a young age I knew the hope that comes from seeing good people work to heal our divisions. It’s what led me to become the United States attorney, where I convicted two clansman who murdered four young black girls in a 1963 Birmingham church bombing and delivered long overdue justice. I’m standing in front of an exhibit dedicated to their memory. Alabama has shown me that even our deepest divisions can be overcome because each of us want the same thing, to be treated fairly and given the same opportunities, and the freedom to live with dignity and respect.  Senator Doug Jones: ( 01:14:07 ) Now, some politicians try to pit us against each other, but I believe that Americans have more in common than what divides us. And in November, we have a chance to elect a president who believes that too. I’ve known Joe for more than 40 years. I met him as a wide-eyed law student, and he’s been my friend and champion ever since. The Joe I know is exactly the leader our country needs right now. He can bring people together to find common ground while standing up for what he believes is right. After years of bitter partisanship, he can unite our country and get things done for working families and everyone looking for a better future. Because it’s not about what side of the aisle we’re on, it’s about whether or not we’re on the side of the people.  Senator Doug Jones: ( 01:14:51 ) The great John Lewis would often quote the old African proverb, “When pray, move your feet,” and then challenge us to do just that. “As a nation,” he said, “if we care for the beloved community, we must move our feet, our hands, our resources to build and not tear down, to reconcile and not to divide, to love and not to hate, to heal and not to kill.” In the final analysis. We are one people, one family, one house, the American house, the American family. Vice President Biden understands that and he is who we need as our next president.  Eva Longoria : ( 01:15:31 ) Here we are on a Monday night in 2020, and we need to talk about the post office, the US Postal Service. It is central to so much of our lives. Veterans count on the post office to get their prescriptions. Social security beneficiaries count on the post office to get their checks. Grandparents depend on the post office to send birthday cards to their grandkids. Small businesses need the post office to do business. And guess what? The post office is also one of the ways we cast our votes. To find out how to exercise that right this November, whether by mail or in person text vote, V-O-T-E, to 30330. And here to say more is the first Latina elected to the United States Senate, Senator Catherine Cortez Masto.  Senator Catherine Cortez Masto: ( 01:16:31 ) Hello, I’m Senator Catherine Cortez Masto from Nevada. This year more Americans than ever before are going to vote from rooms just like this, marking their ballots at the kitchen table and exercising one of our most fundamental rights from home. But despite what the President says, voting by mail has been a secure, proven option for decades. In 2016, 33 million Americans voted by mail. Even Donald Trump has requested an absentee ballot twice this year. This fall, some Americans will choose to vote in a voting booth with a mask on, while many of us will choose to Vote by Mail. My home state took the advice of scientists and medical experts and listened to the people of Nevada to put in place a Vote by Mail system, so voters have a lot of options this fall. But Donald Trump is trying to divide us by undermining that right. He has threatened to withhold federal funding to Nevada because of our Vote by Mail system.  Senator Catherine Cortez Masto: ( 01:17:29 ) That’s funding our schools and seniors rely on. He has challenged us in court with a meritless lawsuit. One that our Republican Secretary of State has asked the judge to dismiss. And now he is putting the lives of Nevada seniors at risk by trying to defund the post office. Here’s what that means. Seniors won’t be able to get their prescriptions because he wants to win an election. Well, Mr. President, Nevada is not intimidated by you. America is not intimidated by you. We are united by shared values, shared history, and shared rights, including our fundamental right to vote. And this fall, we will send Joe Biden to the White House and we’ll flip the US Senate. With Mitch McConnell out of power and a democratic majority in the Senate, we will expand voting access and protect voting rights. To do this, America, we need you on our side.  Senator Catherine Cortez Masto: ( 01:18:29 ) So go to joebiden.com right now to chip in and then head over to flipthesenate.com to help us take back the Senate. Donald Trump and Mitch McConnell know how to divide, but we know how to stand together and turn this country around.  Eva Longoria : ( 01:18:50 ) This year, we had an historic field of presidential candidates, a historic number of women, including our Vice Presidential nominee, Kamala Harris, more candidates of color than any primary ever, and the first openly gay man to win a caucus. This party, the democratic party, welcomes everyone, encourages everyone to lead, and invites everyone’s ideas to ensure this country builds back better. This is what our next speaker believes too, Senator Amy Klobuchar.  Speaker 4: ( 01:19:23 ) Okay.  Senator Amy Klobuchar: ( 01:19:30 ) Hello America. Like my friend, Catherine, I believe that the right to vote is fundamental, and the post office is essential. The president may hate the post office, but he’s still going to have to send them a change of address card come January. Donald Trump just happens to be in my state today trying to divide people instead of responding to the pandemic and the significant needs of our economy, but Democrats, Independents, and yes, many Republicans have had enough of his divisiveness. Tonight my friends in contrast, we’ve heard a lot about how we can unite as Americans about our shared values, our shared dreams, how we’ve come together in the face of crisis. But I want to be clear. Unity isn’t about settling. It’s about striving for something more. It isn’t the end. It’s the means. It’s how we get stuff done. Unity is about reaching up toward a higher purpose, a better future for all of us.  Senator Amy Klobuchar: ( 01:20:34 ) E pluribus Unum, out of many, one. It is more than a motto. It is the north star for our democracy. Now more than ever, we need a president who will unite this country. We need a president who, in George Floyd’s memory, instead of using the Bible as a prop, will heed its words to act justly. We need a president for the workers who’ve lost their jobs because this administration is selling American workers out when we need to buy American. For the farmers and manufacturers and the people of rural America, who are sick and tired of reaping what he’s sown. We need a president who will look out for the seniors, like my dad, whose families now visit them through glass windows never knowing if it will be the last time they see them. We need a president for all of America. I come from the middle of this country where we believe in people joining together to solve problems.  Senator Amy Klobuchar: ( 01:21:37 ) We seek common ground to reach higher ground. That’s been Joe Biden’s life’s work. He’s a man of scrappy, working class roots. A man whose own hardships have only made him more determined to lift up those who have been left out. He understands redemption and he knows resilience. Joe Biden’s a man of deep experience. Barack Obama, better known tonight as Michelle’s husband, he leaned on Joe for his strength and decency, and you can too. Most candidates when they end their campaign, that day is a hard one. For me, it was a moment filled with great joy because the day I ended my presidential campaign was also the day I endorsed Joe Biden. Joe ran for the same reasons I did. When I announced my campaign in the middle of that blizzard on the banks of the Mississippi River, to cross the river of our divides, to bring this nation together, to be a president for all of America.  Senator Amy Klobuchar: ( 01:22:42 ) As I said, the day I endorsed him. “If you feel stuck in the middle of the extremes, in our politics, if you are tired of the noise and the nonsense, you have a home with me and you have a home with Joe Biden.” That’s why I was so proud to stand with him then, and across this great country. That’s why we are all now standing united behind Joe and my friend Kamala. Our nation’s motto is out of many, one. And as you’re about to see, it’s also the story of the democratic primary. Thank you, America.  Senator Kamala Harris: ( 01:23:28 ) We all ran for president, motivated by the same reasons.  Senator Kirsten Gillibrand: ( 01:23:32 ) As I watched president Trump divide this country more and more, I thought to myself, what are you willing to do to stop him?  Beto O’Rourke: ( 01:23:39 ) You had the most destructive, hateful, racist president in the history of this country, who is literally tearing apart the fabric of the States of America.  Tom Steyer: ( 01:23:50 ) Donald Trump is a failed business person and desperately failed us as a president.  Senator Cory Booker: ( 01:23:54 ) We will run. I ran for president because I think it’s urgent that we heal the divisions in this nation.  Andrew Yang: ( 01:23:59 ) We are still in control of our own future, and we need to provide millions of Americans, a real path forward.  Governor Jay Inslee: ( 01:24:06 ) A green jobs program-  Senator Amy Klobuchar: ( 01:24:08 ) Increasing the minimum wage-  Senator Kirsten Gillibrand: ( 01:24:09 ) Passing a national paid leave bill-  Andrew Yang: ( 01:24:11 ) Student loan debt-  Rep. Seth Moulton: ( 01:24:12 ) Mental health, starting with our veterans.  Senator Kamala Harris: ( 01:24:15 ) Reproductive justice-  Tom Steyer: ( 01:24:17 ) Economic justice-  Senator Cory Booker: ( 01:24:18 ) Racial justice.  Senator Amy Klobuchar: ( 01:24:19 ) And there is so much a new president can do to bring us together.  Vice President Joe Biden: ( 01:24:24 ) It’s time to get up [inaudible 01:24:26].  Rep. Seth Moulton: ( 01:24:28 ) Starting a presidential campaign is daunting. I mean, you have to reach hundreds of billions of people.  Senator Cory Booker: ( 01:24:34 ) You have these incredibly long days, often capped off by these evening events that go on for hours and hours.  Beto O’Rourke: ( 01:24:40 ) Your challenge as a candidate is to be true to yourself and true to why you ran in the first place. That is something by the way, that I really admire about Joe Biden. He really is his own man. He knows who he is.  Senator Kirsten Gillibrand: ( 01:24:52 ) Joe Biden is somebody who deeply cares about people. People who are marginalized, who were being left behind, who are being ignored.  Speaker 6: ( 01:25:00 ) I’m a DACA recipient, and I owe you everything. Thank you so much.  Vice President Joe Biden: ( 01:25:03 ) And you’re staying, man.  Governor Jay Inslee: ( 01:25:05 ) He’s had some hard times in his life. He’s had some losses in his life. And I think that is something that people relate to.  Vice President Joe Biden: ( 01:25:13 ) You’re doing okay?  Speaker 7: ( 01:25:13 ) Yep. 15, close to 15 years cancer free.  Governor Christine Todd Whitman: ( 01:25:17 ) God love you.  Governor Jay Inslee: ( 01:25:18 ) Well, I was at a service for four fallen Afghanistan soldiers. I saw those families who were so comforted by Joe Biden. When they walked out, they knew someone cared for them. Someone could relate to their own pain they were having. We need that in the White House.  Senator Cory Booker: ( 01:25:31 ) I still remember standing side by side with him on the debate stage. And we were having a go of it, but what was remarkable to me was in the commercial break, he puts his arm around me and starts telling me how good my ideas are. And next thing you know, I feel like he’s giving me a pep talk and literally telling me how important it is, how really important it is that I’m on that stage.  Andrew Yang: ( 01:25:57 ) Joe called me the night I suspended and was extraordinarily gracious and comforting. And he told me, I should be proud of myself, said that I did myself and my family a real service, and the country of service. And that meant a lot coming from Joe.  Governor Jay Inslee: ( 01:26:13 ) Look, it’s not easy to unite the democratic party. We’re a rambunctious group. Joe Biden has pulled it off.  Andrew Yang: ( 01:26:20 ) He wants to get the best ideas on the table, so we can move forward in the best way possible.  Senator Kirsten Gillibrand: ( 01:26:25 ) He’s included my family bill of rights.  Governor Jay Inslee: ( 01:26:27 ) He has unified our group around a clean energy strategy.  Senator Kamala Harris: ( 01:26:31 ) The domestic worker’s bill of rights, I’m very excited that that’s in there.  Beto O’Rourke: ( 01:26:35 ) He’s the kind of leader that brings other leaders in.  Senator Cory Booker: ( 01:26:39 ) This is a guy that’s going to walk into the oval office and not have to find his way around, but will actually walk in and have already sort of honed the instincts you need to lead the most powerful nation on earth through a crisis.  Senator Kamala Harris: ( 01:26:56 ) On the other side, Donald Trump does not understand who we are as Americans. He really doesn’t.  Senator Amy Klobuchar: ( 01:27:03 ) This is a guy that blames everyone for everything. He blames the city of Baltimore. He blames the country of Denmark. He blames the Prime Minister of Canada for cutting him out of the Canadian version of Home Alone 2. Who does that?  Beto O’Rourke: ( 01:27:21 ) There are no sidelines. There’s no sitting this one out. There’s no hoping that someone else is going to come in and save the day. There is no cavalry. We are the cavalry.  Tom Steyer: ( 01:27:29 ) The moment has found the person. That person is Joe Biden.  Senator Amy Klobuchar: ( 01:27:34 ) Joe has my vote because he will bring decency and dignity back to the White House.  Senator Cory Booker: ( 01:27:39 ) We’ve got one shot to make Donald Trump a one term president, and that shot is right now.  Crowd: ( 01:27:46 ) It’s Joe time. It’s Joe time.  Speaker 8: ( 01:27:46 ) This president right here.  Eva Longoria : ( 01:27:52 ) We understand that things are tough right now, economically. But if we’re going to beat Donald Trump in November, we need your help. If you’re able to go to joebiden.com and chip in five, 10 dollars, whatever you can, to fund the change we need to save our democracy because every bit matters. And it’s going to take all of us to make this happen. And no one knows that more than our next speaker, the Biden Harris campaign’s co-chair, Representative Cedric Richmond from New Orleans, Louisiana.  Rep. Cedric Richmond: ( 01:28:23 ) Think about the places that make your neighborhood feel like home. The barbershop, where you can catch up on the latest neighborhood news while you get your hair cut. The restaurant, where they know your order by heart, or this art studio, where a creative guy with a great idea, and a ton of hustle turned an abandoned building into a second home for the entire community. Economists will tell you that small businesses like this one are critically important to our recovery, but they’re also just plain important. Without them, the places we call home just wouldn’t be the same. That’s the thing Joe Biden understands, that Donald Trump never has and never will. When we talk about the economy, it’s not just about the stock market. It’s about whether you can find work that really means something to you, instead of feeling like you’re supposed to be grateful just to get a paycheck.  Rep. Cedric Richmond: ( 01:29:15 ) It’s about whether people who didn’t inherit millions from their parents can build a business from the ground up and have a real chance to compete. And it’s about whether in the richest country on earth, everyone, including women and people of color, feel included and empowered. Economists will also tell you that Joe Biden’s plan to rebuild our economy will create millions of jobs. But Joe will tell you that his plan is about more than that because he’s seen the world from a different perspective than most politicians. He knows what it’s like to live in a real neighborhood, not just penthouse apartments. He knows what it’s like to take the train to work, not just a chauffeured limousine. That’s why he looks at our economic challenges the same way working people do. And he’ll solve them in a way that puts working people first. Joe Biden respects America’s workers because he truly understands the dignity of work.  Greg Weaver: ( 01:30:15 ) It was mostly small talk when we first met. When I would collect his ticket and time went on, I learned more and more about him as our friendship grew. I think he’s most comfortable around everyday, working class people. Just always makes you feel like you belong.  Speaker 9: ( 01:30:43 ) For more than 30 years, Joe Biden took the train to work. As a single dad, he promised to be home to kiss the boys every night and then make them breakfast in the morning.  Greg Weaver: ( 01:31:01 ) When he got on the train, everyone seemed equal to him. He had time for everybody.  Speaker 9: ( 01:31:06 ) Joe was a regular. He bought rounds of coffee for fellow passengers and crew. And he got to know the people he traveled with.  Vice President Joe Biden: ( 01:31:15 ) These guys broke their necks. They’re always rocking, keeping their balance, collecting tickets, help people with their bags that’re heavy as hell, and they’re doing this for hours. And we became really good friends.  Greg Weaver: ( 01:31:29 ) He was very interested in my life, my children, as time went on my grandchildren. People don’t do that today. People don’t even take time out to say hello or nod their head to the average working person. They looked at us like we were important people.  Ashley Biden: ( 01:31:46 ) He would treat the conductor the same as he would the President of the United States. That is what dad taught us, that everybody deserves to be treated with dignity and respect.  Speaker 9: ( 01:31:59 ) After Joe became Vice President, he cut down on his commute, but he kept in touch. When Greg Weaver had a heart attack, he got a phone call.  Greg Weaver: ( 01:32:11 ) I was in a barber shop in New York City and the phone rings. And sure enough, it was Vice President Biden asking me how I’m doing, he wanted to know the whole story. It’s kind of funny that you’re talking to the Vice President of the United States. But if I would have told them people in the barbershop, I don’t think they would’ve believed me. I’m not saying it like it was me and I was anything special. Everybody was special to him. We have heroes all over this country and a lot of the essential workers out there that we don’t even see that are behind the scenes, they’re keeping this country going. He understands that. The average guy is important to him. The average guy is important to him.  Speaker 4: ( 01:32:55 ) Go.  Senator Bernie Sanders: ( 01:33:03 ) Good evening. Our great nation is now living in an unprecedented moment. We’re facing the worst public health crisis in a hundred years, and the worst economic collapse since the great depression. We are confronting systemic racism and the enormous threat to our planet of climate change. And in the midst of all of this, we have a president who is not only incapable of addressing these crises, but is leading us down the path of authoritarianism. This election is the most important in the modern history of this country. In response to the unprecedented crises we face, we need an unprecedented response, a movement like never before, of people who are prepared to stand up and fight for democracy and decency, and against greed, oligarchy, and bigotry. And we need Joe Biden as our next president. Let me take this opportunity to say a word to the millions of people who supported my campaign this year and in 2016.  Senator Bernie Sanders: ( 01:34:19 ) My friends, thank you for your trust, your support, and the love you show Jane, me, and our family. Together we have moved this country in a bold new direction, showing that all of us, black and white, Latino, Native American, Asian American, gay and straight, native born and immigrant, yearn for a nation based on the principles of justice, love, and compassion. Our campaign ended several months ago, but our movement continues and is getting stronger every day. Many of the ideas we fought for, that just a few years ago were considered radical on now mainstream. But let us be clear if Donald Trump is re-elected, all the progress we have made will be in jeopardy. At its most basic, this election is about preserving our democracy. During this president’s term, the unthinkable has become normal. He has tried to prevent people from voting, undermined the US Postal Service, deployed the military and federal agents against peaceful protestors, threatened to delay the election, and suggested that he will not leave office if he loses.  Senator Bernie Sanders: ( 01:35:46 ) This is not normal and we must never treat it like it is. Under this administration, authoritarianism has taken root in our country. I and my family and many of yours, know the insidious way authoritarianism destroys democracy, decency, and humanity. As long as I am here, I will work with Progressive’s, with Moderates, and yes, with Conservatives to preserve this nation from a threat that so many of our heroes fought and died to defeat. This president is not just a threat to our democracy, but by rejecting science, he has put our lives and health in jeopardy. Trump has attacked doctors and scientists trying to protect us from the pandemic, while refusing to take strong action, to produce the masks, gowns, and gloves our healthcare workers desperately need. Nero fiddled while Rome burned. Trump golfs. His actions fanned this pandemic resulting in over 170,000 deaths and a nation still unprepared to protect its people.  Senator Bernie Sanders: ( 01:37:17 ) Furthermore, Trump’s negligence has exacerbated the economic crisis we are now experiencing. Since this pandemic began, over 30 million people have lost their jobs and many have lost their health insurance. Millions of working families are wondering how they will feed their kids, and they’re worried that they will be evicted from their homes. And how has Trump responded? Instead of maintaining the $600 a week unemployment supplement that workers were receiving, and the $1,200 emergency checks that many of you received… Instead of helping small businesses, Trump concocted fraudulent executive orders that do virtually nothing to address the crisis, while threatening the very future of Social Security and Medicare.  Senator Bernie Sanders: ( 01:38:14 ) But the truth is that even before Trump’s negligent response to this pandemic, too many hardworking families have been caught on an economic treadmill with no hope of ever getting ahead. Together, we must build a nation that is more equitable, more compassionate, and more inclusive. I know that Joe Biden will begin that fight on day one. Let me offer you just a few examples of how Joe will move us forward. Joe supports raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour. This will give 40 million workers a pay raise, and push the wage scale up for everyone else. Joe will also-  Senator Bernie Sanders: ( 01:39:03 ) Paid scale up for everyone else. Joe will also make it easier for workers to join unions, create 12 weeks of paid family leave, fund universal pre-K for three and four year olds and make childcare affordable for millions of families. Joe will rebuild our crumbling infrastructure and fight the threat of climate change by transitioning us to 100% clean electricity over the next 15 years. These initiatives will create millions of good paying jobs all across our country. As you know, we are the only industrialized nation not to guarantee healthcare for all people. While Joe and I disagree on the best path to get universal coverage, he has a plan that will greatly expand healthcare and cut the cost of prescription drugs. Further, he will lower the eligibility age of Medicare from 65 down to 60.  Senator Bernie Sanders: ( 01:40:12 ) To help reform our broken criminal justice system. Joe will end private prisons and detention centers, cash bail, and the school to prison pipeline. To heal the soul of our nation, Joe Biden will end the hate and division trump has created. He will stop the demonization of immigrants, the coddling of white nationalists, the racist dog whistling, the religious bigotry, and the ugly attacks on women.  Senator Bernie Sanders: ( 01:40:45 ) My friends, I say to you, to everyone who supported other candidates in the primary and to those who may have voted for Donald Trump in the last election, the future of our democracy is at stake. The future of our economy is at stake. The future of our planet is at stake. We must come together, defeat Donald Trump, and elect Joe Biden and Kamala Harris as our next president and vice president. My friends, the price of failure is just too great to imagine. Thank you.  Anne S.: ( 01:41:46 ) My American dream is to have an America where we have people in affordable housing.  Thelma S.: ( 01:41:53 ) For every human being in this country to have access to quality healthcare and economic means care for themselves and families.  Kori F: ( 01:42:01 ) Access to a quality and equitable education.  Paul Y.: ( 01:42:04 ) A system of government that protects the workers and their families.  Ryan W.: ( 01:42:08 ) Joe Biden, throughout his career has focused on rebuilding the middle class.  Russ: ( 01:42:13 ) We need a leader that actually supports our unions for our hard working people.  Andrew L.: ( 01:42:18 ) Real leadership to show genuine support for small businesses during this downturn due to the COVID crisis.  Kori F: ( 01:42:24 ) I believe Joe Biden has the experience, the platform and the empathy to build America bath better.  Laura H.: ( 01:42:33 ) He wants good things for all Americans, not just a select few.  Eva Longoria : ( 01:42:46 ) The voices we long to hear right now are the ones that speak with courage and kindness, strength and wisdom, love and compassion. They’re unafraid to speak the truth and talk about their own uncertainties and struggles. They make us feel seen and inspire us to become the best versions of ourselves. Our next speaker is that for all of us. It is my honor and privilege to introduce the former First Lady, Michelle Obama.  Michelle Obama: ( 01:43:21 ) Good evening, everyone. It’s a hard time and everyone’s feeling it in different ways. I know a lot of folks are reluctant to tune in to a political convention right now, or to politics in general. Believe me, I get that. But I am here tonight because I love this country with all my heart, and it pains me to see so many people hurting. I’ve met so many of you. I’ve heard your stories and through you, I have seen this country’s promise and thanks to so many who came before me, thanks to their toil and sweat and blood, I’ve been able to live that promise myself.  Michelle Obama: ( 01:44:08 ) That’s the story of America. All those folks who sacrificed and overcame so much in their own times because they wanted something more, something better for their kids. There’s a lot of beauty in that story. There’s a lot of pain in it, too. A lot of struggle and injustice and work left to do. Who we choose as our president in this election will determine whether or not we honor that struggle and chip away at that injustice and keep alive the very possibility of finishing that work.  Michelle Obama: ( 01:44:49 ) I am one of a handful of people living today who have seen firsthand the immense weight and awesome power of the presidency. And let me once again, tell you this, the job is hard. It requires clear-headed judgment, a mastery of complex and competing issues, a devotion to facts and history, a moral compass, and an ability to listen. And an abiding belief that each of the 330 million lives in this country has meaning and worth.  Michelle Obama: ( 01:45:33 ) A president’s words have the power to move markets. They can start wars or broker peace. They can summon our better angels or awaken our worst instincts. You simply cannot fake your way through this job. As I’ve said before, being president doesn’t change who you are, it reveals who you are. Well, a presidential election can reveal who we are too, and four years ago too many people chose to believe that their votes didn’t matter. Maybe they were fed up. Maybe they thought the outcome wouldn’t be close. Maybe the barriers felt too steep. Whatever the reason, in the end, those choices sent someone to the oval office who lost the national popular vote by nearly three million votes. In one of the states that determined the outcome, the winning margin averaged out to just two votes per precinct, two votes.  Michelle Obama: ( 01:46:44 ) We’ve all been living with the consequences. When my husband left office with Joe Biden at his side, we had a record breaking stretch of job creation. We’d secured the right to healthcare for 20 million people. We were respected around the world, rallying our allies to confront climate change. Our leaders had worked hand in hand with scientists to help prevent an Ebola outbreak from becoming a global pandemic. Four years later, the state of this nation is very different. More than 150,000 people have died, and our economy is in shambles because of a virus that this president downplayed for too long. It has left millions of people jobless. Too many have lost their healthcare. Too many are struggling to take care of basic necessities like food and rent. Too many communities have been left in the lurch to grapple with whether and how to open our schools safely.  Michelle Obama: ( 01:47:58 ) Internationally, we’ve turned our back, not just on agreements forged by my husband, but on alliances championed by presidents like Reagan and Eisenhower. Here at home as George Floyd, Brianna Taylor, and a never ending list of innocent people of color continue to be murdered, stating the simple fact that a black life matters is still met with derision from the nation’s highest office. Because whenever we look to this White House for some leadership or consolation or any semblance of steadiness, what we get instead is chaos, division, and a total and utter lack of empathy.  Michelle Obama: ( 01:48:50 ) Empathy. That’s something I’ve been thinking a lot about lately. The ability to walk in someone else’s shoes, the recognition that someone else’s experience has value too. Most of us practice this without a second thought. If we see someone suffering or struggling, we don’t stand in judgment. We reach out. Because there but for the grace of God go I. It is not a hard concept to grasp. It’s what we teach our children. Like so many of you, Barack and I have tried our best to instill in our girls, a strong moral foundation to carry forward the values that our parents and grandparents poured into us.  Michelle Obama: ( 01:49:40 ) But right now, kids in this country are seeing what happens when we stop requiring empathy of one another. They’re looking around wondering if we’ve been lying to them this whole time about who we are and what we truly value. They see people shouting in grocery stores, unwilling to wear a mask to keep us all safe. They see people calling the police on folks, mind in their own business, just because of the color of their skin. They see an entitlement that says only certain people belong here. That greed is good and winning is everything. Because as long as you come out on top, it doesn’t matter what happens to everyone else.  Michelle Obama: ( 01:50:29 ) They see what happens when that lack of empathy is ginned up into outright disdain. They see our leaders labeling fellow citizens enemies of the state while emboldening torch bearing white supremacists. They watch in horror as children are torn from their families and thrown into cages and pepper spray and rubber bullets are used on peaceful protesters for a photo op. Sadly, this is the America that is on display for the next generation. A nation that’s underperforming, not simply on matters of policy, but on matters of character. That’s not just disappointing, it’s downright infuriating because I know the goodness and the grace that is out there in households and neighborhoods all across this nation. I know that regardless of our race, age, religion, or politics, when we close out the noise and the fear and truly open our hearts, we know that what’s going on in this country is just not right. This is not who we want to be.  Michelle Obama: ( 01:51:54 ) So what do we do now? What’s our strategy. Over the past four years, a lot of people have asked me when others are going so low, does going high still really work? My answer, going high is the only thing that works because when we go low, when we use those same tactics of degrading and dehumanizing others, we just become part of the ugly noise that’s drowning out everything else. We degrade ourselves. We degrade the very causes for which we fight. But let’s be clear going high does not mean putting on a smile and saying nice things when confronted by viciousness and cruelty. Going high means taking the harder path. It means scraping and clawing our way to that mountaintop. Going high means standing fierce against hatred while we’re remembering that we are one nation under God, and if we want to survive, we’ve got to find a way to live together and work together across our differences. Going high means unlocking the shackles of lies and mistrust with the only thing that can truly set us free, the cold hard truth.  Michelle Obama: ( 01:53:25 ) So let me be as honest and clear as I possibly can. Donald Trump is the wrong president for our country. He has had more than enough time to prove that he can do the job, but he is clearly in over his head. He cannot meet this moment. He simply cannot be who we need him to be for us. It is what it is. Now I understand that my message won’t be heard by some people. We live in a nation that is deeply divided, and I am a black woman speaking at the Democratic convention. But enough of you know me by now, you know that I tell you exactly what I’m feeling. You know I hate politics.  Michelle Obama: ( 01:54:16 ) But you also know that I care about this nation. You know how much I care about all of our children. So if you take one thing from my words tonight, it is this. If you think things cannot possibly get worse, trust me, they can and they will if we don’t make a change in this election. If we have any hope of ending this chaos, we have got to vote for Joe Biden like our lives depend on it.  Michelle Obama: ( 01:54:50 ) I know Joe. He is a profoundly decent man guided by faith. He was a terrific vice president. He knows what it takes to rescue an economy, beat back a pandemic and lead our country. He listens. He will tell the truth and trust science. He will make smart plans and manage a good team. He will govern as someone who’s lived a life that the rest of us can recognize. When he was a kid, Joe’s father lost his job. When he was a young senator, Joe lost his wife and his baby daughter, and when he was vice president, he lost his beloved son. So Joe knows the anguish of sitting at a table with an empty chair, which is why he gives his time so freely to grieving parents. Joe knows what it’s like to struggle, which is why he gives his personal phone number to kids overcoming a stutter of their own. His life is a testament to getting back up, and he is going to channel that same grit and passion to pick us all up, to help us heal and guide us forward.  Michelle Obama: ( 01:56:11 ) Now, Joe is not perfect, and he’d be the first to tell you that. But there is no perfect candidate, no perfect president, and his ability to learn and grow, we find in that the kind of humility and maturity that so many of us yearn for right now. Because Joe Biden has served this nation his entire life without ever losing sight of who he is. But more than that, he has never lost sight of who we are, all of us. Joe Biden wants all of our kids to go to a good school, see a doctor when they’re sick, live on a healthy planet. He’s got plans to make all of that happen.  Michelle Obama: ( 01:57:04 ) Joe Biden wants all of our kids, no matter what they look like, to be able to walk out the door without worrying about being harassed or arrested or killed. He wants all of our kids to be able to go to a movie or a math class without being afraid of getting shot. He wants all our kids to grow up with leaders who won’t just serve themselves and their wealthy peers, but will provide a safety net for people facing hard times. If we want a chance to pursue any of these goals, any of these most basic requirements for a functioning society, we have to vote for Joe Biden in numbers that cannot be ignored.  Michelle Obama: ( 01:57:52 ) Because right now, folks who know they cannot win fair and square at the ballot box are doing everything they can to stop us from voting. They’re closing down polling places in minority neighborhoods. They’re purging voter rolls. They’re sending people out to intimidate voters, and they’re lying about the security of our ballots. These tactics are not new, but this is not the time to withhold our votes in protest or play games with candidates who have no chance of winning. We have got to vote like we did in 2008 and 2012. We’ve got to show up with the same level of passion and hope for Joe Biden. We’ve got to vote early, in person if we can. We’ve got to request our mail in ballots right now, tonight, and send them back immediately, and follow up to make sure they’re received, and then make sure our friends and families do the same. We have got to grab our comfortable shoes, put on our masks, pack a brown bag dinner, and maybe breakfast too, because we’ve got to be willing to stand in line all night if we have to.  Michelle Obama: ( 01:59:11 ) Look, we have already sacrificed so much this year. So many of you are already going that extra mile. Even when you’re exhausted, you’re mustering up unimaginable courage to put on those scrubs and give our loved ones a fighting chance. Even when you’re anxious, you’re delivering those packages, stocking those shelves and doing all that essential work so that all of us can keep moving forward. Even when it all feels so overwhelming. Working are somehow piecing it all together without childcare. Teachers are getting creative so that our kids can still learn and grow. Our young people are desperately fighting to pursue their dreams. When the horrors of systemic racism shook our country and our consciousness, millions of Americans of every age, every background rose up to march for each other, crying out for justice and progress. This is who we still are.  Michelle Obama: ( 02:00:24 ) Compassionate, resilient, decent people whose fortunes are bound up with one another. It is well past time for our leaders to once again reflect our truth. So it is up to us to add our voices and our votes to the course of history, echoing heroes, like John Lewis, who said, “When you see something that is not right, you must say something. You must do something.” That is the truest form of empathy. Not just feeling but doing, not just for ourselves or our kids, but for everyone, for all our kids. If we want to keep the possibility of progress alive in our time, if we want to be able to look our children in the eye after this election, we have got to reassert our place in American history, and we have got to do everything we can to elect my friend, Joe Biden, as the next president of the United States. Thank you all, God bless.  Eva Longoria : ( 02:02:09 ) Wow. Wow, wow. Thank you, Michelle Obama, you are what we miss in this country. We need more of that example. Thank you so much for being part of this unconventional convention. Thanks to all of you all who have been tuning in. It’s a convention about you and for you, the American people. This is our chance to hear from those who will be leading us out of our nation, out of the current crisis, on the economy, the pandemic, racial injustice. To listen and to learn Joe Biden and Kamala Harris’s plans to bring about changes we all need. This is our chance to unite across America. In addition, we’ll call the roll and we’ll hear from the future first lady, Dr. Jill Biden. I want to thank you again for joining us. Join us the rest of the week. This is your convention. This is your campaign. We, the people, are going to save this democracy in November. Right now, Billy Porter and Stephen Stills are going to remind us what it’s all worth. Good night.  Billy Porter: ( 02:03:18 ) (singing)  Bennie Thompson: ( 02:06:28 ) We, the people, call the 4th quadrennial democratic national convention in order.  Speaker 10: ( 02:06:35 ) Today we gather virtually. However, we gather unified in spirit, unified in our values and purpose.  Speaker 11: ( 02:06:43 ) It’s up to us to carry on the fight for justice. Our actions will be our legacies.  Joe Biden: ( 02:06:50 ) You just got to keep pushing. You can’t let up.  Speaker 12: ( 02:06:53 ) Joe Biden and Kamala Harris will lead by example. It will be science, not politics or ego that will drive their decisions. They know what the health of our people goes hand in hand with the strength of our economy.  Speaker 13: ( 02:07:08 ) My dad was a healthy 65 year old. His only preexisting condition was trusting Donald Trump, and for that he paid with his life.  Senator Bernie Sanders: ( 02:07:19 ) The future of our democracy is at stake. The future of our economy is at stake. The future of our planet is at stake.  Joe Biden: ( 02:07:30 ) If we want to be able to look our children in the eye after this election, we have got to reassert our place in American history, and we have got to do everything we can to elect my friend, Joe Biden, as the next president of the United States.  Jerry Young: ( 02:07:48 ) Hello, I am Pastor Jerry Young. Let us pray together. Almighty God, we are grateful to You for having granted to our nation the democratic ideal by which our destiny may be fashioned. We are thankful to You for having blessed these United States of America to survive the climate of confusion and chaos, racism and injustice, uncertainty, helplessness and irresponsibility. We now, oh Lord, invoke your presence and participation throughout the life of this convention. It is our prayer that you will enable this convention to produce a vision that will promote healing, hope, and health for our nation. A vision that will inspire, inform, and be inclusive of all Americans. A vision that will rekindle in us a renewed commitment to the high ideal of our democracy, that we are created equal and are endowed by the Creator with certain inalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.  Jerry Young: ( 02:09:03 ) We would pray that you would grant to those to whom we will entrust with the authority of government to be competent, compassionate, courageous, committed, and consecrated, and guide us, the people, to support them and all good and wise legislation that we all may prosper under an equal law, defend our liberties, and grant us a sense of our own responsibility. Achieve unity of purpose among us and grant unto us the victory of faith and freedom in the ideas to which we are committed as a nation. Strengthen us with honor and grant us peace. Provide us, oh God, with the strength and spiritual sustenance to do justly, to love mercy, and to walk humbly with our God. In the strong name of Jesus, amen.  Bennie Thompson: ( 02:10:06 ) Delegates and distinguished guests. We’ve concluded this evening’s convention program. The convention we’ll stand in recess until tomorrow evening.

Speaker 1: ( 00:00 ) (Silence).  Speaker 1: ( 21:36 ) … Joe Biden. We also reaffirmed our values as a party, the party of resilience and hope, empathy and inclusion. This is the party that fired me up as a young man in the ’60s registering voters with the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee in the Mississippi Delta and campaigning for Ms. Fannie Lou Hamer for the United States House of Representatives. It’s the party that taught me that public servants should serve the public even when your opponents call you names like nasty or slow. And today, it’s the party that calls us to stand up for what’s right, and to get in good trouble. So on behalf of this great party, it’s my pleasure to welcome once again, delegates, alternates, standing committee members, friends, and fellow Americans, members of the media and guests from around the world. I now call this third session of the 48th Quadrennial National Convention of the Democratic Party to order. Now let’s get this show started.  Speaker 2: ( 22:53 ) And now, live from Wisconsin, please welcome Governor Tony Evers.  Gov. Tony Evers: ( 23:02 ) Good evening folks. I’m Tony Evers, and I’m incredibly proud to be the 46th governor of the great state of Wisconsin. We were really looking forward to having you here in America’s Dairyland. Unfortunately, the pandemic means we can’t do that this year. But what unites us is far, far greater than what divides us. So even though we can’t be with each other, I know we have a shared sense of purpose, that is to elect Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. This November is about returning kindness, respect, empathy, and civility back to the White House, and that’s who Joe and Kamala are, because they know, especially during challenging times like these, the problems we face can only be solved by all of us together. Holy macro, folks, let’s get to work.  Terry Williams: ( 24:16 ) Hello. My name is Terry Williams, and I’ve been a Republican for all of my adult life.  Donna N.: ( 24:19 ) A lifelong Republican.  Alan P.: ( 24:21 ) Republican.  Garry: ( 24:21 ) A lifelong Republican.  Michael: ( 24:23 ) I’ve been a longstanding Republican. And I’m telling you, you got to vote for Joe Biden.  Debra: ( 24:28 ) I have voted for and campaigned for Republicans since the Reagan years, but I won’t be voting for Donald Trump in November.  Garry: ( 24:34 ) I’m supporting Joe Biden for president.  Donna N.: ( 24:37 ) We need a positive leader. Someone who can work with both sides, Republicans and the Democrats.  Michael: ( 24:44 ) I don’t think we can deal with the type of person we have in the White House any longer.  Terry Williams: ( 24:49 ) Vote America. That’s the only way to get out of this and Joe Biden is just the person to ensure we get our lives back to normal.  Garry: ( 24:56 ) Joe Biden is a decent man with a long history of public service to America.  Debra: ( 25:00 ) He will restore order and integrity to the executive branch.  Alan P.: ( 25:04 ) I would strongly encourage all of us to come together.  Garry: ( 25:07 ) And hopefully return our country’s political discourse back to some measure of normalcy and decency.  Michael: ( 25:13 ) I’m sure, I’m absolutely sure he’s going to help us bring this country together once again.  Group: ( 25:43 ) I pledge allegiance to the flag.  Speaker 3: ( 25:51 ) Of the United States of America.  Group: ( 25:51 ) And to the republic for which it stands, one nation…  Speaker 4: ( 25:54 ) One nation.  Speaker 5: ( 25:55 ) One nation.  Group: ( 25:56 ) Under God, indivisible.  Speaker 6: ( 25:58 ) With liberty.  Group: ( 25:58 ) And justice for all.  Kamala Harris: ( 26:03 ) Hey, everybody. It’s me, Kamala. So before I go on stage later tonight, I want to talk about the importance of voting. I know many of you plan to vote this year, but amidst the excitement and enthusiasm for this election, you’ve also heard about obstacles and misinformation and folks making it harder for you to cast your ballot. So I think we need to ask ourselves, why don’t they want us to vote? Why is there so much effort to silence our voices? And the answer is because when we vote, things change. When we vote, things get better. When we vote, we address the need for all people to be treated with dignity and respect in our country. So each of us needs a plan, a voting plan. Joe and I want to make sure you’re prepared. If you text, vote, to 30330, we’ll help you come up with your plan and remember deadlines and get ready to vote in your community.  Kamala Harris: ( 27:10 ) So send that text and encourage your family and friends to send one too. Now, let’s enjoy another night of inspiration from around our country. I’ll see a little later tonight. And until then, I turn it over to my dear friend and tonight’s moderator, Kerry Washington.  Kerry Washington: ( 27:33 ) Welcome to night three of the Democratic National Convention. I’m honored to be joining you as we continue to celebrate this unconventional convention. We’re going to be hearing a lot more from Senator Harris later, I promise. But first, when I was in seventh or eighth grade, we memorized the preamble of the constitution and I’ve never forgotten it. The first 15 words of our constitution are, we the people of the United States, in order to form a more perfect union, we say, more perfect, because our union is not without flaws. When our constitution was written, women couldn’t vote, black people were considered three fifths of a human being, but there in lies the work. No one is perfect, nothing is, but it is the striving toward justice, equality and truth that distinguishes us. We fight for a more perfect union because we are fighting for the soul of this country and for our lives.  Kerry Washington: ( 28:40 ) And right now, that fight is real. Tonight, we are going to hear from so many phenomenal women who are working to help us build that more perfect union; Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Secretary Hillary Clinton, Senator Elizabeth Warren, Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham. We’re going to see an incredible performance from Jennifer Hudson and a world premier performance from Billie Eilish. We’ll meet so many of the activists and organizers working to build a more equal, more just future. And we’re going to hear from our 44th president, Barack Obama. That’s a long way of saying this is going to be an unforgettable night filled with important voices. But the most important voice we hope to hear from tonight is the one we need to hear from most, it’s yours. Because if we are going to repair the damage that has been done, if we are going to finally realize the dream, we the people have to get involved.  Kerry Washington: ( 29:45 ) Each and every one of us is the we. You are the we. It’s going to be your voice, your service, your action that helps us create that more perfect union. Tonight, we’re going to talk about where we are and where we’re going on so many issues important to our future. 90% of Americans support common sense gun laws, because we need to do more to address the epidemic of gun violence. Let’s start there.  Emma G.: ( 30:23 ) People affected by everyday gun violence have to walk by the street corner where their best friend, their brother, their mother, their nephew, where they themselves were shot, and life goes on and on as if we all haven’t just watched a loved one die and get put in the grave. The whole point of what I’m saying here is until one of us or all of us stand up and say, I can’t do this anymore, I can’t sit by and watch the news treat these shootings like acts of God, gun violence isn’t just going to stop until there’s a force fighting harder against it, and I’m going to do something to prevent it. They say that tougher gun laws do not decrease gun violence. We call…  Audience: ( 31:11 ) BS.  Emma G.: ( 31:15 ) They say a good guy with a gun stops a bad guy with a gun. We call…  Audience: ( 31:18 ) BS.  Emma G.: ( 31:21 ) They say guns are just tools like knives. We call…  Audience: ( 31:24 ) BS.  Emma G.: ( 31:27 ) They say that no laws could have been able to prevent the hundreds of senseless tragedies that have occurred. We call…  Audience: ( 31:33 ) BS.  Emma G.: ( 31:37 ) That us kids don’t know what we’re talking about. That we’re too young to understand how the government works. We call…  Audience: ( 31:43 ) BS.  Emma G.: ( 31:48 ) Well, what we’re fighting for will happen because we’re fighting so strongly for it. We’re going to make this change.  Maria W.: ( 32:02 ) Long before this pandemic, our country has been suffering from the epidemic of gun violence.  Shenee J.: ( 32:07 ) Gun violence is a public health crises. One that disproportionately affects the black and brown communities. First, it was my beloved fiance.  Maria W.: ( 32:17 ) My son, Jerry, at the Pulse shooting in Orlando.  Shenee J.: ( 32:21 ) Seven years later, it would be my son.  Maria W.: ( 32:24 ) I know exactly the pain, the toll, heartbreak of gun violence.  Lylena E.: ( 32:30 ) My freshman year, my high school went into lockdown because a kid brought a gun to school.  Joseph M.: ( 32:35 ) We’ve had to endure live shooter training drills in our schools.  Lylena E.: ( 32:38 ) High schoolers have enough to deal with. They shouldn’t also be responsible for keeping themselves safe at school. That’s the job of the government.  Joseph M.: ( 32:46 ) We have to end corporate lobbying by the NRA. We have to invest in mental health in our communities rather than making our schools maximum security prisons.  Shenee J.: ( 32:54 ) I want a president who will make gun violence prevention a top priority, and I believe Joe Biden is that person.  Speaker 2: ( 33:03 ) And now, mother and activist, Deandra Dycus.  Deandra Dycus: ( 33:16 ) In a split second, a stray bullet shattered my family’s life. My son, Deandre, was only 13 years old. He was recognized as a gifted and talented student, his possibilities were endless. He was dancing at a birthday party when he was shot in the back left side of his head, shattering his skull. One shot changed our lives forever. Today, my Dre does not talk, he does not walk. I know he knows me by the smile he shows when I walk in his room, but I’m unsure if he knows a gunshot has changed his life. Since March, I’ve only been-  Deandra Dycus: ( 34:03 ) It’s just life. Since March, I’ve only been able to see my son three times, but I can’t touch or hug him due to COVID-19. People tell me that I’m lucky. I tell them we are blessed. I remind them that my son is in a wheelchair and unable to feed his self. I don’t think Deandre feels lucky when he has to be bathed from head to toe or gets injections for muscle contractions. I am in a space of gratitude.  Deandra Dycus: ( 34:31 ) Yes, I can touch Deandre. I can hold his hand, but the child that I birthed is not able to live his dreams, and that hurts. Every day, we’re reminded that he may never be the same. We are not alone. In every town across America, there are families who know what a bullet can do. That’s why my mom who volunteers to stop this.  Deandra Dycus: ( 34:58 ) President Trump, he doesn’t care. He didn’t care about the victims after Parkland, Las Vegas or El Paso. I want a president who cares about our pain and grief, a president who will take on the gun lobby to banned assault weapons and close the loopholes to keep guns out of the hands of criminals. Joe Biden has taken on the NRA twice and won. And he will do it again as president.  Joe Biden: ( 35:29 ) I’ve looked in the eyes of too many parents, and I mean literally scores of them who’ve lost their children to gun violence. And looked in the eyes of brave young people who survived school shootings. I made each of them a promise. I made myself a promise. I promised them and I promise all of you, I will make this promise today, those families hurting across the country, I will never, never, never, never give up this fight.  Speaker 7: ( 36:13 ) Out of pain, we choose to find meaning. A glimmer of light that lands on a promise. Former Congresswoman Gabby Giffords shot in the head from less than three feet away, but she survived. When tragedy strikes, we seek comfort in knowing we aren’t alone.  Gabby Giffords: ( 36:35 ) Join us in this fight.  Speaker 7: ( 36:38 ) We seek strength to keep fighting, to keep moving forward. We turn to leaders who share our pain.  Joe Biden: ( 36:49 ) In the most difficult times is when we stand closest together. It’s out of tragedy that we go stronger.  Gabby Giffords: ( 36:57 ) He was there for me. He’ll be there for you too.  Speaker 7: ( 37:01 ) We are a nation ready to end gun violence. A safer America is possible. But from this point forward, we must choose courage.  Gabby Giffords: ( 37:14 ) I’ve known the darkest of days, days of pain and unsure to the recovery. But confronted by despair, I’ve summoned hope. Confronted by paralysis and ataxia, I responded with grit and determination. I put one foot in front of the other. I’ve found one word and then I found another. My recovery is a daily fight, but fighting makes me stronger. Words once came easily. Today, I struggled to speak, but I have not lost my voice. America needs all of us do speak out even when you have to fight to find the words.  Gabby Giffords: ( 38:07 ) We are at a crossroads. We can let the shooting continue or we can act. We can protect our families, our future. We can vote. We can be on the right side of history. We must elect Joe Biden. He was there for me. He’ll be there for you too. Join us in this fight. Vote, vote, vote. Thank you very much.  Kerry Washington: ( 38:43 ) Tonight, we’re going to hear from many change makers who are using their powers for good, who are working to confront the other epidemics we’re facing. COVID-19, structural racism, police violence against black bodies, violence against members of the trans community. We are facing so many challenges. To meet these challenges, we will need systematic solutions. We need leaders who can see us, hear us, represent us, all of us. To Joe Biden, nothing is more important than taking the time to make sure that people are seen, heard, and believed in.  Kyle: ( 39:26 ) I was interning in DC and I remember I called my grandmother and I said, “Joe Biden is walking by.” And she goes, “Oh my God, oh my God. Put him on.” And I see his staff were going like, “No, no, no. Don’t take the call. What are you doing?” And he points to a staff and he goes like, “Go that way.” And he sent his staffer away.  Speaker 8: ( 39:44 ) How could I not endeared to him instantly? He talked to me for the next hour.  Kyle: ( 39:50 ) I see Dana Bash from CNN there, and she says like, “Senator Biden will be on in five.” And he sends her away.  Speaker 8: ( 39:56 ) He asked me about my son. He asked me about what I did. All I know, it was all about me, not about him.  Kyle: ( 40:06 ) And then he comes back to me, then he goes, “It was lovely talking to your grandmother.” And then he starts the interview with Dana Bash. It was unbelievable.  Speaker 8: ( 40:13 ) I must interject one thing. At the very end of his chat with me, he said, “Could you do me a favor?” I said, “Sure, what is it?” He said, “Tell me how I can get your grandson’s hair?” He was good humor. He was sensitive, and here it is all these years later, and it’s vivid in my mind.  Kyle: ( 40:40 ) As much as I feel like I got to know him in that moment, it feels like he knows us. I know Joe because he listens, and whether he’s heard your story or someone else’s story, he cares about everyone’s story.  Speaker 8: ( 40:52 ) He’ll care more about you than he’ll care about himself.  Kerry Washington: ( 41:01 ) What a beautiful story. Okay. Now, let’s talk about another important issue, the climate crisis. This is an issue that has been on Joe Biden’s mind for decades. In 1986, while working as a Senator, Joe Biden introduced one of the first climate bills in Congress, and he’s continued to listen to and work with climate advocates and activists putting forward a plan to address climate change and create a clean energy economy.  Kerry Washington: ( 41:35 ) ( singing)  Matthew: ( 41:35 ) There are battles that we need to fight and we need to win to secure our future in this country, but there’s one issue that is an existential threat to all of us and that is climate change.  Michelle D: ( 41:45 ) The climate crisis is here and we must act.  Claire: ( 41:48 ) It is the most pressing issue of our time and we deserve to be treated as such.  Jeanna H: ( 41:53 ) We no longer have any time to wait.  David M: ( 41:55 ) Our generation will bear the burden of past mistakes, but we stand to benefit most from changing course now.  Claire: ( 42:00 ) We know that in a couple of years, it will be too late.  Jeanna H: ( 42:03 ) We need to change the paradigm, and that happens here with us.  Michelle D: ( 42:07 ) We should invest massively in wind, solar, geothermal, green infrastructure.  Onelica A: ( 42:11 ) Moving away from fossil fuels and being highly competitive in renewables.  Matthew: ( 42:16 ) We need to lay out our specific policies.  Speaker 9: ( 42:19 ) So that we can give our children, my children, your children, a planet that can sustain.  Matthew: ( 42:24 ) That needs to happen now.  Claire: ( 42:26 ) We need it now.  Michelle D: ( 42:27 ) The moment demands it. We can afford nothing less.  Michelle Lujan Grisham: ( 42:49 ) Good evening America. I’m Michelle Lujan Grisham, governor of the great state of Nuevo Mexico. I’m proud of my home state every single day, especially how we have punched above our weight in our successful response to COVID-19. I’m proud of New Mexicans from Taos to truth or consequences who have stepped up and sacrificed in so many incredible ways this past half year.  Michelle Lujan Grisham: ( 43:12 ) And I’m proud how we embrace our multicultural identity as our greatest strength. And I’m proud that New Mexico has shown what climate leadership looks like. While the Trump administration has been eliminating environmental protections, we’ve expanded them. While they’ve been rolling back regulations on oil and gas, we’ve taken on polluters and held them accountable.  Michelle Lujan Grisham: ( 43:33 ) We’ve committed to a renewable energy future with exciting and fulfilling careers for workers all across our beautiful state, including right here in the heart of Northern New Mexico. We’re laying a roadmap here for what America can and should look like in the 21st century.  Michelle Lujan Grisham: ( 43:51 ) An America where we lead again, where we build safer, cleaner, and more affordable cities and communities, where we provide meaningful opportunities for workers and families to thrive and build better lives.  Michelle Lujan Grisham: ( 44:04 ) As president, Joe Biden will rejoin the international climate agreement and the United States will once again, lead on this critical issue. At home, he’ll invest in energy workers and he will deliver for working families across the US helping them build meaningful careers while accelerating our nation and world into a clean, green 21st century and well beyond.  Michelle Lujan Grisham: ( 44:29 ) We know time is running out to save our planet. We have the chance this November to end two existential crises, the Trump presidency and the environmental annihilation he represents. We have the chance this November to attack the climate crisis, invest in green 21st century jobs and embrace the clean energy revolution our country, our young people are crying out for and the leadership the rest of the world is waiting for. The choice is clear. The choice is Joe Biden. Thank you, America.  Speaker 10: ( 45:09 ) Hard work, rising to a challenge, the American way. Going to the moon was all three. Many astronauts returned home and reported a shift in their awareness. The view they saw of Earth from space was profound. The world looked beautiful, tiny, fragile. Our atmosphere is all that separates us from oblivion. We now call what they experienced the overview effect.  Justin Onwenu: ( 45:43 ) Here in Detroit, in our communities for such a long time have faced the burden of pollution. I think addressing climate change gives us an opportunity to correct some those wrongs and to also invest in our vulnerable communities.  Speaker 10: ( 45:59 ) Maybe you’ve read some of the millions of pages of scientific evidence on climate change.  Male: ( 46:03 ) A crushing storm surge.  Speaker 10: ( 46:04 ) Or maybe you felt it as you walk the neighborhood.  Female: ( 46:06 ) Oh my god, the truck is sinking.  Speaker 10: ( 46:08 ) For most people, it’s overwhelming.  Donald Trump: ( 46:10 ) All of this with the global warming and da, da. A lot of it is a hoax. It’s a hoax.  Dr. Maria Caffrey: ( 46:15 ) I had spent five years working on this report. The Trump administration started to remove any mention that humans were the cause of climate change from it.  Dr. Joel Clement: ( 46:23 ) I wrote my resignation letter just six months into the administration. They were handing the keys of public lands over to private interests. The Trump administration has gone all out. Not just to neglect climate change issues and laws, but to reverse them.  Speaker 10: ( 46:39 ) We have about a decade before it’s too late.  Kid: ( 46:43 ) I’m a kid and I’m going to say to all those adults who are watching this right now, why don’t you get up and do something.  Speaker 10: ( 46:50 ) Some of the first climate change legislation ever written was by a Senator from Delaware.  Joe Biden: ( 46:57 ) When Donald Trump thinks about climate change, the only word he can muster is hoax.  Speaker 10: ( 47:03 ) America faces a challenge, but if we face it together, we will rise to the occasion and build back better.  Joe Biden: ( 47:11 ) When I think about climate change, the word I think of is jobs.  Speaker 10: ( 47:16 ) That’s Joe’s plan to create millions of new good paying jobs. Many of them union like mine invest in critical infrastructure, upgrade millions of buildings, invest in micro mobility and precision agriculture. A clean energy future that achieves net zero emissions by 2050, because we can’t power the economies of the future without investing in the technologies of the future.  Justin Onwenu: ( 47:43 ) I think what’s really important about Joe Biden’s plan is that 40% of the investment will go to vulnerable communities.  Joe Biden: ( 47:51 ) We know how to do this, and we’ll do it again, but this time bigger, and faster, and smarter.  Speaker 10: ( 47:59 ) Joe won’t ignore the crisis, or seeing what happens when we do that, he won’t surrender to the fight. Joe’s America will lead the world on clean energy, will lead on job creation and America will lead the world again on climate.  Alexandria Villaseñor: ( 48:24 ) I was 13 when the Camp Fire, the most destructive wildfire in California’s history broke out. We were visiting family, nearly a hundred miles away, but my asthma flared badly. I could hardly breathe.  Alexandria Villaseñor: ( 48:36 ) I’m Alexandria Villaseñor and I’ve been organizing young people around climate change since 2018. Climate change is impacting us now, and it’s robbing my generation of a future. For young people my age, every aspect of our lives from where go to school to what kind of careers we’ll have to whether or not we can raise a family, depends on us taking climate change seriously, right now. Joe Biden won’t solve this crisis in four years. No one can. But he will put us back on track so that my generation can have a fighting chance. I’m asking you to join us. Don’t let our futures go up in flames.  Andrew Adamski: ( 49:14 ) The corn growers near my parents’ farm have a saying, knee-high by the 4th of July. These days are lucky if the corn is even planted because of unpredictable and torrential spring rains. I’m Andrew Adamski. I studied microbial ecology at Northern Michigan University.  Andrew Adamski: ( 49:28 ) Us farmers can see the effects of climate change happening right in front of us, so we’ve been trying to do our part. We’re adopting sustainable solutions on my family’s farm, switching to a community model, using less land and reusing our resources to grow our food.  Andrew Adamski: ( 49:42 ) We are eliminating tons of carbon pollution every year by mimicking natural ecosystems. Farmers can be part of the climate solution instead of a problem. Today, we all can grow our own future, but we need our leaders to be part of the solution as well instead of part of the problem. We need them to commit to the science, not ignore it. We need them to put real plans [inaudible 00:50:01] rather than roll them back. That’s what Joe Biden is doing with his clean energy revolution. Instead of being left behind, we could lead the world again.  Katherine Lorenzo: ( 50:10 ) I spent a lot of time talking about climate change with different communities here in Nevada. And the one question that I get asked over and over again is, “What are you doing here?” Not a lot of climate activists looked like me. My name is Catherine Lorenzo. I’m an Afro-Latina and I’m a climate activist.  Katherine Lorenzo: ( 50:27 ) I grew up in a low income neighborhood where pollution rates are often higher than wealthier areas, and a lot of kids have asthma. Switching to renewable energy would mean cleaner air, better health, and a steady income for folks in neighborhoods like mine because solar PV installers and wind turbine [inaudible 00:50:44] are some of the fastest growing jobs in the country. And Joe Biden’s plan is transformative.  Katherine Lorenzo: ( 50:49 ) He knows that saving the planet. Isn’t just a challenge to overcome, it’s an opportunity for a better way of life.  Andrew Adamski: ( 50:56 ) So what’s it going to be America?  Alexandria Villaseñor: ( 50:58 ) Are you ready to vote for Joe Biden?  Katherine Lorenzo: ( 51:00 ) Are you ready to solve the climate crisis?  Alexandria Villaseñor: ( 51:03 ) Because our futures depend on it.  Kerry Washington: ( 51:10 ) Like the folks we just heard from, next up is another activist and environmentalist, not to mention an immensely talented artist. She worked to ensure that her most recent concert tour was green and sustainable urging her fans to take similar actions in their daily lives. And even before she herself was old enough to vote, she held registration drives before her shows, signing up thousands of voters. She’s a voice for her generation in both her music and her activism. Here to perform My Future publicly for the first time, Billie Eilish.  Billie Eilish: ( 51:49 ) You don’t need me to tell you things are a mess. Donald Trump is destroying our country and everything we care about. We need leaders who will solve problems like climate change and COVID not deny them. Leaders who will fight against systemic racism and inequality. And that starts by voting for someone who understands how much is at stake. Someone who’s building a team that shares our values. It starts with voting against Donald Trump and for Joe Biden.  Billie Eilish: ( 52:19 ) Silence is not an option and we cannot sit this one out. We all have to vote like our lives and the world depend on it because they do. The only way to be certain of the future is to make it ourselves. Please register. Please vote. (singing)  Kerry Washington: ( 56:04 ) Billie Eilish. Thank you. Okay. Now, we’re going to talk about something close to my heart. The black community in this country is hugely diverse. On my father’s side, I am descended from African-Americans who came from slave ships that landed in South Carolina and who were part of the great migration north that has played such a defining role in who we are as a nation. On my mother’s side, my grandparents came here as immigrants, part of a rich history that has also defined America.  Kerry Washington: ( 56:39 ) They immigrated to this country from the West Indies through Ellis Island in the 1920s. I often think about how my grandmother must have felt when she first saw the statue of Liberty in her raised torch. My family story is not unique. Unless you’re native American, your family likely came here from somewhere else, whether it was five years ago or 200 years ago. Whether it was by choice or by bondage.  Kerry Washington: ( 57:06 ) Etched into the DNA of who we are as a nation is the very idea that though you may be from somewhere else, you can find your home here. But that idea is in danger, now more than ever before.  Estella: ( 57:24 ) Tell me when I start reading. Dear Donald Trump. My name is Estella. I am 11 years old. My mom is my best friend. She came to America as a teenager over 20 years ago without papers in search of a better life. She married my dad who served our country as a Marine in South America, Africa and Iraq. My mom worked hard and pay taxes. And the Obama administration told her she could stay.  Estella: ( 57:59 ) My dad thought he would protect military families, so we voted for you in 2016, Mr. President. He says he won’t vote for you again after what you did to our family.  Female: ( 58:09 ) A wife of a US Marine veteran was deported to Mexico.  Estella: ( 58:13 ) Instead of protecting us, you tore our world apart. My mom is a good person and she’s not a criminal. Now, my mom is gone and she’s been taken from us for no reason at all. Every day that passes, you deport more moms and dads and take them away from kids like me.  Donald Trump: ( 58:36 ) We will begin moving them out in day one.  Estella: ( 58:42 ) You separated thousands of children from their parents and you put them in cages. Some of those kids are now orphans because of you.  Donald Trump: ( 58:53 ) These aren’t people. I don’t want them in our country. They’re animals.  Estella: ( 58:58 ) Mr. President, my mom is the wife of a proud American Marine and a mother of two American children. We are American families. We need a president who will bring people together, not tear them apart. Sincerely, Estella.  Lucy Sanchez: ( 59:19 ) I’m Lucy Sanchez, and this is my mother, Sylvia and sister, Jessica. We’re like all families. We work hard to build a good life.  Jessica: ( 59:27 ) I was born with spina bifida. That means my spinal cord didn’t form like they should. And the doctors in my town said I wouldn’t survive. They gave my mother no hope for my future.  Lucy Sanchez: ( 59:38 ) I’m a US citizen, but my mother is undocumented.  Jessica: ( 59:42 ) And I am a dreamer.  Lucy Sanchez: ( 59:45 ) My mother did by any mother would do to save her baby’s life.  Lucy Sanchez: ( 59:59 ) She took my sister in her arms and traveled for days to reach the border. And when they got to the river, she lifted my sister above the water and crossed.  Jessica: ( 01:00:06 ) We came to America before I was one year old. She saved my life.  Lucy Sanchez: ( 01:00:16 ) My mother had no choice. There was no time to wait to save my sister. She came here looking for a miracle.  Lucy Sanchez: ( 01:00:21 ) We were afraid they would find us and detain us, but she had to save her daughter.  Jessica: ( 01:00:32 ) Our home is here, North Carolina. It’s all I know. I qualify for DACA, but Donald Trump took away my ability to apply for the program.  Lucy Sanchez: ( 01:00:41 ) We work hard. We contribute to our community and we pay our taxes. I’ve gone to school and built a good life for me and my two daughters.  Jessica: ( 01:00:52 ) I want to go to law school. I want to help my community, but ever since Donald Trump was elected, all our fears have returned.  Lucy Sanchez: ( 01:01:00 ) We don’t know if our family will be separated. Will my mom and sister be detained? Will my sister get the healthcare she needs and deserves?  Jessica: ( 01:01:06 ) I don’t have the right ID. So I can’t get health insurance through the exchange. I need health insurance. I deserve it, right?  Lucy Sanchez: ( 01:01:28 ) It breaks our hearts to see children separated from their families at the border. That’s wrong. Those children need their parents. On November 3rd, I’m going to vote for my mother, my sister and my daughters. I have a vote for a future where all of our lives have dignity and respect.  Jessica: ( 01:01:41 ) We need a leader who will fix the broken immigration system and commit to keeping families together.  Lucy Sanchez: ( 01:01:47 ) I’m voting for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, the daughter of immigrants. Who are you going to vote for?  Barack Obama: ( 01:02:00 ) There’s something unique about America. We don’t simply welcome new immigrants. We are born of immigrants. That is who we are. Immigration is our origin story. After all, unless your family is Native American, all of our families come from someplace else. These new Americans, we see our own American stories. Life in America was not always easy. There was discrimination and hardship, and poverty. But Like you, they no doubt found inspiration in all those who had come before them, and they were able to muster faith that here in America, they might build a better life, give their children something more.  Barack Obama: ( 01:03:01 ) The tension throughout our history between welcoming or rejecting the stranger, it’s about more than just immigration. It’s about the meaning of America.  Barack Obama: ( 01:03:15 ) What kind of country do we want to be? Immigrants are the teachers who inspire our children. They’re the doctors who keep us healthy. They’re the engineers who designed our skylines and the artists and the entertainers who touch our hearts. Immigrants are soldiers, sailors, airmen, marines, coast guards who protect us.  Barack Obama: ( 01:03:40 ) We can never say it often or loudly enough. Immigrants and refugees revitalize and renew America. It’s not something to take for granted. It’s something to cherish and to fight for. God bless you and God bless the United States of America.  Prince Royce: ( 01:04:45 ) (singing) Mejente, let’s stand by each other. Don’t forget to vote this November. Together we can make a chance. [Spanish 01:07:16] Let’s go.  Kerry Washington: ( 01:07:24 ) That was Prince Royce. Amazing. Shout out to the boogie down Bronx. In this next piece, you’ll hear about the vital role that women have played in moving us toward a more perfect union and breaking through that proverbial glass ceiling. And after that, you’ll hear from Secretary Hillary Rodham Clinton, the woman who put over 65 million cracks in it.  Speaker 11: ( 01:08:00 ) ( singing)  Speaker 11: ( 01:08:01 ) She was called an instigator. A ruled…  Speaker 11: ( 01:08:03 ) She was called an instigator, a rule breaker, a rabble rouser, and she is called the agitator, the pushy one, the one with attitude.  Michelle Obama: ( 01:08:15 ) No is the time for all of us to stand up and say enough is enough.  Speaker 11: ( 01:08:27 ) From the ballot box to the factory floor, from her living room to the ER, she makes trouble, the good kind. She is the mother who cries out for sensible gun laws. The daughter who believes that equal justice means justice for all.  Speaker 12: ( 01:08:48 ) We are America.  Speaker 11: ( 01:08:51 ) The child who knows that black lives matter. She is our warrior on the front lines challenging authority to make the world safe.  Ms. Demings: ( 01:09:04 ) Nobody is above the law.  Speaker 11: ( 01:09:08 ) Refusing to be told who makes decisions about her body or anyone else’s.  Speaker 13: ( 01:09:13 ) These women and men of all ages, races and backgrounds don’t come to Planned Parenthood to make a political statement. They come to get quality, affordable healthcare.  Speaker 14: ( 01:09:24 ) You are disadvantaging her because of her sex.  Speaker 15: ( 01:09:36 ) This is the time.  Speaker 11: ( 01:09:38 ) And she knows that to change the world, you need to change the idea of power.  Speaker 16: ( 01:09:44 ) Excuse me Mr. Barr his is my time and I control it.  Speaker 17: ( 01:09:47 ) Because we are fighting for you each and every single day.  Speaker 11: ( 01:09:51 ) And she knows her voice is heard and amplified by the women she elects to public office.  Speaker 18: ( 01:09:59 ) If we want families to succeed we start by empowering women.  Debbie Mucarsel-Powell: ( 01:10:05 ) When I first got elected I came to Washington DC to fight for the issues that are so important in our community.  Speaker 19: ( 01:10:12 ) We look forward though to making sure that this district is finally well-represented.  Speaker 20: ( 01:10:15 ) The things that we ran on going into November we are doing that.  Speaker 21: ( 01:10:19 ) Women don’t just fight for women, they fight for families, they fight for fairness, inclusion, justice.  Speaker 22: ( 01:10:28 ) To make our nation a more perfect union especially for those people who are the most marginal.  Speaker 23: ( 01:10:33 ) If we’re going to jumpstart the middle class, we’ve got to ensure that college is affordable.  Speaker 24: ( 01:10:38 ) Separation of families and children are detrimental to their health.  Speaker 25: ( 01:10:42 ) Give the victims of gender bias in the workplace the tools they need to seek justice.  Speaker 26: ( 01:10:48 ) Women are the most important political force in the United States of America.  Speaker 11: ( 01:10:52 ) She represents her views on education.  Speaker 27: ( 01:10:54 ) We’ve got to pay educators more and we’ve got to hire more educators.  Speaker 28: ( 01:11:01 ) We’re going to raise up the profile of teachers and celebrate who they are and give them better pay.  Speaker 11: ( 01:11:06 ) She represents her concerns about healthcare.  Speaker 29: ( 01:11:10 ) Healthcare is the number one issue of this election every day, every day.  Speaker 11: ( 01:11:13 ) She speaks out on equal pay.  Speaker 30: ( 01:11:16 ) It’s very frustrating for women everywhere because you feeling like they aren’t getting paid what they should be.  Speaker 11: ( 01:11:21 ) And focuses on protecting our children.  Speaker 31: ( 01:11:24 ) Let’s give parents the peace of mind that their kids are safe and are being set up for success.  Speaker 11: ( 01:11:30 ) Caring for our seniors and the people who care for them. She keeps this nation going even in challenging times. And while running for office is not easy.  Speaker 32: ( 01:11:44 ) What’s wrong with somebody running for president of this country?  Speaker 11: ( 01:11:47 ) Nevertheless, she persists.  Warren: ( 01:11:49 ) But we learned a long time ago you don’t get what you don’t fight for.  Speaker 11: ( 01:11:55 ) And perseveres.  Speaker 33: ( 01:11:57 ) This is our time.  Speaker 11: ( 01:12:00 ) And prevails.  Hillary Clinton: ( 01:12:02 ) Although we weren’t able to shatter that highest, hardest glass ceiling this time, it’s got about 18 million cracks in it.  Speaker 34: ( 01:12:13 ) A record breaking number of women ran in the midterms and won.  Speaker 11: ( 01:12:17 ) She builds coalitions and she knows who her allies are. From the fight for healthcare to offering the violence against women’s act. To building a society where fairness and equality and opportunity applies to everyone. Joe Biden knows a stronger America is one that works for women. So go ahead and celebrate you gravel browser, you rule breaker, you force of nature. Our country, our world needs you. Keep rising and vote.  Hillary Clinton: ( 01:13:10 ) The morning after the last election I said we owe Donald Trump and open mind and the chance to lead, I meant it. Every president deserves that. And Trump came in with so much set up for him. A strong economy, plans for managing crises including a pandemic. Yes, we Democrats would have disagreed with him on many things, but if he had put his own interests and ego aside, seeing the humanity in a child ripped from her parents at the border or a protestor calling for justice or a family wiped out by natural disaster, that would have been a good thing for America and the world. I wish Donald Trump knew how to be a president because America needs a president right now. Throughout this time of crisis Americans keep going, checking on neighbors, showing up to jobs as first responders, hospitals, grocery stores, nursing homes. Yes, it still takes a village and we need leaders equal to this moment of sacrifice and service.  Hillary Clinton: ( 01:14:16 ) We need Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. Everyone has a story about Joe’s caring and empathy. I remember him calling after my mother Dorothy died and we talked about being raised by strong women. The best testament to Joe is how he’s cared for his family. And how great is it that Dr. Jill Biden plans to keep teaching as first lady. And Joe picked the right partner in Kamala. She’s relentless in the pursuit of justice and equity and she’s kind. When her press secretary Tyrone Gail was dying of cancer she dropped everything to be with him in his final moments. I know something about the slings and arrows she’ll face and believe me, this former district attorney and attorney general can handle them all. So this is the team to pull our nation back from the brink. But they can’t do it without us. For four years people have told me I didn’t realize how dangerous he was.  Hillary Clinton: ( 01:15:20 ) I wish I could do it all over or worst, I should have voted. Look, this can’t be another would have, could have, should have election. If you vote by mail, request your ballot now and send it back right away. If you vote in person, do it early. Become a poll worker. Most of all no matter what vote. As Michelle Obama and Bernie Sanders warned us if Trump is reelected things will get even worse. That’s why we need unity now more than ever. Remember back in 2016 when Trump asked, “What do you have to lose?” Well, now we know. Our healthcare, our jobs, our loved ones, our leadership in the world and even our post office. But let’s set our sights higher than getting one man out of the white house. Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are going to give us so much to vote for. Let’s vote for the jobs that Joe’s plan will create.  Hillary Clinton: ( 01:16:25 ) Clean energy jobs to fight climate change, caregiving jobs with living wages. Vote for emergency relief that lifts small businesses and saves hardworking people from foreclosures and evictions. It’s wrong that billionaires got $400 billion richer during the pandemic while millions lost their $600 a week in extra unemployment. Vote for the parents and teachers struggling to balance children’s education and safety. And for healthcare workers fighting COVID- 19 with little help from the white house. Vote for paid family leave and healthcare for everyone. For social security, Medicare and Planned Parenthood. Vote for dreamers and their families. Vote for law enforcement purged of racial bias that keeps all our streets safe. Vote for justice for George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and Ahmaud Arbery because black lives matter. Vote for honest elections so we not a foreign adversary choose our president. Vote for the diverse hopeful America we saw in last night’s roll call. And don’t forget, Joe and Kamala can win by 3 million votes and still lose, take it from me.  Hillary Clinton: ( 01:17:53 ) So we need numbers overwhelming so Trump can’t sneak or steal his way to victory. Text Vote 30330 to get started. A hundred years ago yesterday the 19th amendment to the constitution was ratified. It took seven decades of suffragists marching, picketing and going to jail to push us closer to a more perfect union. 55 years ago John Lewis marched and bled in Selma because that work was unfinished. Tonight I’m thinking of the girls and boys who see themselves in America’s future because of Kamala Harris. A black woman, the daughter of Jamaican and Indian immigrants and our nominee for vice president. This is our country’s story, breaking down barriers and expanding the circle of possibility.  Hillary Clinton: ( 01:18:48 ) And to the young people watching, don’t give up on America. Despite our flaws and problems we’ve come so far, we can still be a more just equal country with opportunities previous generations could never have imagined. There’s a lot of heartbreak in America now and the truth is many things were broken before the pandemic. But as the saying goes, the world breaks everyone and afterward many are strong at the broken places. That’s Joe Biden. He knows how to keep going, unify and lead because he’s done that for his family and country. So come November if we’re strong together, we’ll heal together. We’ll redeem the soul. And the promise of our country led by president Joe Biden and vice-president Kamala Harris  Kerry Washington: ( 01:19:48 ) Tonight is a night steeped in women who have stepped into service and advocacy and who are using their power for good. The power of women is undeniable. Whether it’s in the office, in the home or in the house of representatives. It is my honor to introduce the speaker of the house, Nancy Pelosi.  Nancy Pelosi: ( 01:20:13 ) I was never raised in a way that I would be running for public office, it didn’t interest me. When I graduated from college I got married, had five children in six years. So that was my life. When the children were grown the opportunity to run for Congress came along.  Speaker 11: ( 01:20:31 ) She ran because another woman said run and she won. Starting on a path that would make history. The first woman speaker of the house.  Nancy Pelosi: ( 01:20:43 ) For our daughters and our granddaughters today we have broken the marble ceiling.  Speaker 11: ( 01:20:52 ) In her so many saw themselves.  Nancy Pelosi: ( 01:20:56 ) I did feel a real responsibility to other women as I stood on the shoulders of those who went before.  Speaker 11: ( 01:21:03 ) Now, it was her turn to say run and run they did. Winning and making her speaker once again.  Nancy Pelosi: ( 01:21:13 ) We didn’t have a speaker who would bring a gun bill to the floor. We didn’t have a speaker who would bring a dreamer’s issue to the floor, we do now.  Speaker 11: ( 01:21:20 ) And that’s good for every American, but not everyone was on board.  Trump: ( 01:21:26 ) Nancy Pelosi, Pelosi, Pelosi.  Nancy Pelosi: ( 01:21:28 ) I’m a mother of five, grandmother of nine I’m [inaudible 01:21:31]. The power of the speaker is awesome. Awesome. If you want to go into the arena you have to be prepared to take a punch. But you also have to be prepared to throw a punch for the children.  Speaker 35: ( 01:22:01 ) Throw a punch for the children.  Speaker 11: ( 01:22:06 ) From running the house to speaker of the house and taking on the white house unapologetic, unafraid. Madam speaker.  Speaker 11: ( 01:22:16 ) And now please welcome speaker of the United States house of representative, Nancy Pelosi.  Nancy Pelosi: ( 01:22:33 ) Good evening. As speaker of the house it’s my honor to bring you the greetings of House Democrats, the most diverse majority in history. More than 60% women, people of color and LGBTQ. Our diversity is our strength. Our unity is our power. This month as America marks the Centennial of women finally winning the right to vote we do so with 105 women in the house. Proudly 90 are Democrats. To win the vote women marched and fought and never gave in. We stand on their shoulders, charged with carrying forward the unfinished work of our nation, advanced by heroes from Seneca Falls to Selma to Stonewall. Four years ago when president Obama and vice president Biden were in the white house, they made us proud and their leadership made our country great. In that spirit, we come together now not to decry the darkness, but to light a way forward for our country.  Nancy Pelosi: ( 01:23:33 ) That is the guiding purpose of house Democrats, fighting for the people. We have sent the Senate bills for lower healthcare costs, for bigger paychecks, for cleaner government protecting John Lewis’ voting rights and enacting George Floyd justice and policing act. We’ve sent the Senate bills to protect our dreamers, LGBTQ equality, prevent gun violence and to preserve our planet for future generations and even more. All of this is possible for America. Who is standing in the way? Mitch McConnell and Donald Trump.  Nancy Pelosi: ( 01:24:09 ) Our nation faces the worst health and economic catastrophe in our history. More than 5 million Americans are infected by the coronavirus. Over 170,000 have died. The science based action and the heroes act we enacted three months ago is essential to safeguard lives, livelihood and the life of our democracy. And who is standing in the way? Mitch McConnell and Donald Trump. Instead of crushing the virus they’re trying to crush the affordable care act and it’s preexisting conditions benefit. As speaker of the house I’ve seen firsthand Donald Trump’s disrespect for facts, for working families and for women in particular. Disrespect written into his policies toward our health and our rights, not just his conduct. But we know what he doesn’t that when women succeed America succeeds.  Nancy Pelosi: ( 01:25:06 ) And so we are unleashing the power of women to take our rightful place in our national life. By championing a woman’s right to choose and defending Roe V. Wade. Secure safe and affordable childcare, preserving social security and passing equal pay for equal work. Who standing in the way? Mitch McConnell and Donald Trump. So here is our answer. We will remember in November when we will elect Joe Biden president whose heart is full of love for America and rid the country of Trump’s heartless disregard for America’s goodness. Joe Biden’s faith in God gives him the courage to lead. Jill Biden’s love gives him the strength to persevere.  Nancy Pelosi: ( 01:25:49 ) Joe Biden is the president we need right now. Battle tested, forward looking, honest and authentic. He has never forgotten who he is fighting for. And Kamala Harris is the vice president we need right now. Committed to our constitution, brilliant in defending it and a witness to the women of this nation that our voices will be heard. Our mission is to fight for a future equal to the ideals of our founders. Our hopes for our children and the sacrifices of our veterans, our brave men and women in uniform and their families. We’ll increase our majority in the house, we will win a democratic majority in the Senate. We will elect Kamala Harris vice president and we will elect Joe Biden president of the United States of America. God bless you. And God bless America.  Kerry Washington: ( 01:26:46 ) Thank you speaker Pelosi. The house is the people’s house. And to ensure it stays that way we need everyone to help fund our work to elect Joe Biden and Democrats up and down the ballot. If you are able, please go to Joebiden.com now and chip in whatever you can to support this campaign. Last year under speaker Pelosi’s leadership, the house reauthorized the violence against women act. Joe Biden wrote that landmark law nearly 30 years ago. Since then he and other leaders have built on it. But for all of this work women are still not entirely safe. So the work must continue. Joe Biden knows that and he is committed to doing that work. To making sure that women are safe and to making sure our voices are heard. Let’s listen.  Ruth Glenn: ( 01:27:42 ) My name is Ruth Glenn in 1992 my husband shot me and left me for dead. For 13 years my son and I had been abused by him. We finally escaped, but he tracked us down. Back then there was limited help available and no national hotline to call. Local shelters were full. I didn’t even know the name for what was happening to me then. Domestic violence. Now working to end domestic violence is my life’s work.  Mariska Hargitay: ( 01:28:12 ) I’m Mariska Hargitay. When I started doing research to play detective Olivia Benson on Law and Order SVU over 20 years ago, I was shocked to find out how many people, including children experienced physical or sexual abuse. The statistics fueled my resolve and I committed myself to the movement to end this violence.  Carly Dryden: ( 01:28:37 ) My name is Carly Dryden. In my small hometown I didn’t feel like I could speak out about my experience with sexual assault. But at the university of Puget Sound I met an incredible force of people working to end the culture of sexual assault. I went from survivor to advocate.  Ruth Glenn: ( 01:28:56 ) As the president and CEO of the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence, I’ve seen Joe Biden’s passionate leadership in passing the violence against women act. Now domestic violence rates are rising due to this pandemic. We need Congress to reauthorize and enhance that law. We need leaders who believe that a woman’s life is worth fighting for.  Mariska Hargitay: ( 01:29:20 ) Joe Biden is that kind of leader. I created the Joyful Heart Foundation to help survivors heal and to change the way our society response to sexual violence. The vice president has worked tirelessly by our side to end the backlog of hundreds of thousands of untested rape kits. And our work will continue because testing kits not only makes our country safer, but it sends a vital message to survivors that what happened to them matters.  Carly Dryden: ( 01:29:55 ) The most important thing you can say to a survivor is I hear you. That’s why I became a leader and it’s on us. It’s a program started by vice president Biden to eliminate sexual assault on college campuses and support a new generation of advocates, including men and boys. Because if you’re silent you’re complicit and we’re just getting started.  Ruth Glenn: ( 01:30:16 ) I am voting for Joe Biden on behalf of all victims and survivors of domestic violence.  Carly Dryden: ( 01:30:22 ) I’m voting for Joe Biden because it’s on my generation to make sure that we never go back.  Mariska Hargitay: ( 01:30:28 ) I’m voting for Joe Biden for my daughter, for my sons, for all of our children.  Speaker 36: ( 01:30:40 ) First episode was a slap to the face and he broke my eardrum, Punching, kicking, choking, threatening with a knife or a gun.  Speaker 37: ( 01:30:53 ) He had always threatened me if I had ever called the police on him that he would kill me.  Speaker 11: ( 01:31:00 ) You didn’t hear voices like these in the halls of the US Capitol.  Speaker 38: ( 01:31:05 ) My husband stabbed me 13 times and broke my neck while the police were on the scene. I nearly died and I am permanently paralyzed.  Speaker 11: ( 01:31:17 ) Senator Joe Biden invited them to speak.  Speaker 38: ( 01:31:22 ) Women need to be taken seriously, proper police respect can prevent what happened to me from happening to someone else. Thank you.  Joe Biden: ( 01:31:30 ) Thank you.  Victoria Nourse: ( 01:31:37 ) At the time the police considered domestic violence, something that was not a crime in the home, it’s a private matter. And so women were responsible for their own injuries.  Joe Biden: ( 01:31:55 ) I was about to say no, I don’t know. I can only guess how painful that is.  Valarie Biden Owens: ( 01:32:03 ) Growing up, our father said that the greatest of all sins was the abuse of power. He told us when a bully, when someone bigger or stronger takes advantage of you, that is a really grave sin. The expectation was for all four of us, be a person of character. You see something wrong, we were then expected to stand up and do something about it.  Speaker 11: ( 01:32:34 ) When Joe introduced the legislation, few believed it could pass.  Joe Biden: ( 01:32:41 ) Our bill is an ambitious undertaking. It is a first attempt to address violent crimes against women.  Carol Moseley: ( 01:32:47 ) It was hard to get the votes because you had some traditionalist who just didn’t believe that there should be laws about this.  Dr. Jill Biden: ( 01:32:54 ) But Joe doesn’t give up. He’s tenacious. Joe persevered and he’s very good at persuasion.  Joe Biden: ( 01:33:00 ) They’re doing nothing to help them, nothing.  Speaker 11: ( 01:33:03 ) He brought together law enforcement, prosecutors, advocate, and survivors.  Speaker 38: ( 01:33:09 ) Thank you for giving me the opportunity to come and speak.  Speaker 11: ( 01:33:14 ) In 1994 the violence against women act became law and protected millions of American women.  Ron: ( 01:33:21 ) A lot of the change in the attitudes we have about domestic violence were shaped by his leadership on this.  Valarie Biden Owens: ( 01:33:30 ) If you see something wrong, we were then expected to stand up and do something about it.  Kerry Washington: ( 01:33:42 ) If you’re just joining us welcome. Coming up we’re going to hear from president Barack Obama and Senator Kamala Harris, who will talk about the Biden-Harris vision for the future. But in order to get to that more perfect union we have to acknowledge where we are. Today in America we are struggling. Unemployment has skyrocketed and families are fighting to keep their jobs. As Joe Biden says, we need to build back better. To find out how you can join that effort please text Join to 30330 to get plugged into this campaign and to get more information on how to vote and how to volunteer. Joe Biden has a plan to help working families and small businesses. Our next speaker, Hilda Solis, worked alongside him as secretary of labor to make sure that there were good American jobs and that Americans were safe on the job. To hear more about the Biden-Harris economic plan, please welcome Hilda Solis.  Hilda Solis: ( 01:34:45 ) Hello, I’m Hilda Solis. The day vice president Biden swore me in as secretary of labor was one of the proudest moments of my life. My parents realized they had achieved their American dream because the daughter of two blue collar immigrants would make history and give voice to people just like them. American workers need a fighter now more than ever and Joe Biden is that person because he has done it before and I’ve seen it firsthand. He and president Obama made it easier for home care workers to organize. They extended overtime pay to more than 4 million workers. They saved the automobile industry and a whole lot of good union jobs with it. And when millions of families lost their homes my friend from California, Senator Kamala Harris took on the big banks and won. But because of Donald Trump’s failures, we must once again rescue a sinking economy. Millions of Americans are out of work and communities of color are the hardest hit. Millions of essential workers are putting their lives at risk with little protections and millions more are just playing tired.  Hilda Solis: ( 01:36:04 ) That’s why Joe Biden and Kamala Harris actually have a plan not only to recover what we lost, but to improve upon it. To build back better. Creating 5 million good union jobs by bringing back supply chains to America, that’s building back better. Creating millions of jobs by investing in clean energy, that’s building back better. And making sure that working families can afford childcare, that’s how we build back better. So let me borrow and slightly edit something Joe Biden said at my swearing in. When it comes to expanding the economy for all people, no one, no one is going to be a stronger voice than our next president, Joe Biden. The conversation you’re about to see proves it.  Eric Garcetti: ( 01:36:58 ) Behind every business there’s a story.  Speaker 39: ( 01:37:00 ) Small businesses around the country are bearing the economic brunt of the coronavirus pandemic.  Sherrod Brown: ( 01:37:05 ) And behind every business there’s a family.  Speaker 40: ( 01:37:08 ) A lot of people clearly are in pain right now.  Cindy Axne: ( 01:37:11 ) For every farm there’s a fight to stay whole.  Eric Garcetti: ( 01:37:14 ) There’s hard work.  Cindy Axne: ( 01:37:15 ) And there’s heartbreak.  Speaker 40: ( 01:37:16 ) We are going to lose 20 to 30% of our small businesses.  Sherrod Brown: ( 01:37:26 ) This is the story of Kevin and Molly Johnson. A family owned business in Lake County, Ohio.  Kevin Johnson: ( 01:37:34 ) We have 10 to 12 employees on a given day. When COVID-19 hit it was a lot of confusion.  Molly Johnson: ( 01:37:43 ) I remember being scared and being uncertain.  Kevin Johnson: ( 01:37:46 ) Was shut down last week because we ran out of work and we got enough to come in for another week. If we don’t get additional orders in we’re going to have to look at another shutdown.  Sherrod Brown: ( 01:37:56 ) You can’t make a big purchase equipment. You can’t plan for the future.  Molly Johnson: ( 01:37:59 ) We don’t even know if we can cover payroll. When this isn’t going well it’s scary.  Sherrod Brown: ( 01:38:05 ) You’re kind of forgotten, right? The president always bragging about the stock market sort of leaves a lot of small manufacturing companies behind.  Molly Johnson: ( 01:38:13 ) We could use a little help right now. And it just seems like we get one step forward and then two steps back.  Sherrod Brown: ( 01:38:21 ) This is the story of Gurnee Green, who just started a clothing store and then Covid hit.  Gurnee Green: ( 01:38:27 ) Fashion has been a love of mine for since I was a kid, I worked really hard to save money to open this store. Did my ribbon cutting December 14th of 2019. And it was booming and then bam! Here’s Covid. It was scary. No one was buying anything. My employees they’re gone. I reached out to my bank, but they stated that they had no more money. Its gone to a lot of the bigger businesses, a million dollar businesses who get the bailout. And a small business like myself is just to struggle. Being an African-American female business owner under president Trump I feel, how can I say, I’m alone. I’m alone.  Eric Garcetti: ( 01:39:13 ) This is the story of Lien Ta and her two restaurants. One closed and one still open.  Lien Ta: ( 01:39:22 ) It’s always really hard for restaurants to begin. It would be crowded in here with babies and families and crowds outside waiting to get in. It was pretty exciting. And on the day of the shutdown, we were actually reviewed in the Los Angeles times. On that day the virus was announced as a global pandemic.  Eric Garcetti: ( 01:39:43 ) It’s really, really sad to see. And if we don’t turn this around soon, I mean we’re going to see this not just be this year, but you’re going to see goes down for main street USA.  Lien Ta: ( 01:39:51 ) The first decision that I had to make because a hundred people are looking at you and unfortunately the call was to furlough everybody. At this point I don’t even see myself in business next month.  Eric Garcetti: ( 01:40:09 ) [foreign language 00:32:04].  Jorge Figueroa: ( 01:40:13 ) [foreign language 01:40:08].  Eric Garcetti: ( 01:40:14 ) We don’t ask for much from government, but catch us when we’re falling. And I know that it must feel like you’re falling right now without a map.  Lien Ta: ( 01:40:22 ) Restaurants are among the hardest businesses to succeed at. But I was going to do it in a way that was going to provide a successful career for not only myself, but a hundred employees.  Cindy Axne: ( 01:40:35 ) This is the story of Dan Ryner. He’s a fifth generation farmer struggling to keep his business alive. I’m not so sure that president understands that when he thinks about business, I don’t think he thinks about farmers as a business.  Dan Ryner: ( 01:40:49 ) No, he has no clue about this stuff.  Cindy Axne: ( 01:40:51 ) Dan tell me a little bit about the farm.  Dan Ryner: ( 01:40:54 ) We’ve been here since 1864. Trade tariffs with China they’ve been horrible. Part of the language in the trade deal said that China does not have to buy unless the price is to their advantage. What kind of trade deal is that? That’s no deal. Then when COVID hit then everything just plummeted. Getting through now that’s the problem. That’s the day to day battle.  Gurnee Green: ( 01:41:18 ) I believe that Joe Biden will be a clear voice for us. Something that we have not had.  Lien Ta: ( 01:41:24 ) Joe Biden has an understanding of what the average American is experiencing. I think he’s with me.  Joe Biden: ( 01:41:32 ) Enough is enough. It’s time to help small businesses. Middle class folks manage their way through a pandemic.  Dan Ryner: ( 01:41:37 ) I have a lot of confidence in Joe Biden. He’s a fighter and he’s the real deal.  Kevin Johnson: ( 01:41:41 ) We’ve taken a lot of knockdowns and we know that at the end of the day we will endure.  Lien Ta: ( 01:41:47 ) We will rise again.  Gurnee Green: ( 01:41:49 ) Every time I get knocked down I got to get up and keep running. Keep going, keep going.  Elizabeth Warren: ( 01:42:01 ) Tonight we’ve heard from the people who make-  Elizabeth Warren: ( 01:42:03 ) Tonight we’ve heard from the people who make America work, people who put their lives on the line to keep our country going. And since COVID-19 hit, they’ve taken one gut punch after another. And what has the COVID fallout done to our babies? Well, I’m here at the early childhood education center in Springfield, Massachusetts, which has been closed for months. Childcare was already hard to find before the pandemic and now parents are stuck. No idea when schools can safely reopen and even fewer childcare options. The devastation is enormous and the way I see it, big problems demand big solutions.  Elizabeth Warren: ( 01:42:43 ) Now I love a good plan, and Joe Biden has some really good plans. Plans to bring back union jobs in manufacturing and create new union jobs in clean energy. Plans to increase social security benefits, cancel billions in student loan debt and make our bankruptcy laws work for families instead of the creditors who cheat them. These plans reflect a central truth, our economic system has been rigged to give bailouts to billionaires and kick dirt in the face of everyone else. But we can build a thriving economy by investing in families and fixing what’s broken.  Elizabeth Warren: ( 01:43:24 ) Joe’s plan to build back better includes making the wealthy pay their fair share, holding corporations accountable, repairing racial inequities and fighting corruption in Washington. Let me tell you about one of Joe’s plans that’s especially close to my heart, childcare. As a little girl growing up in Oklahoma, what I wanted most in the world was to be a teacher. I loved teaching and when I had babies and was juggling my first big teaching job down in Texas, it was hard but I could do hard. The thing that almost sunk me, childcare. One night, my aunt Bee called just to check in and I thought I was fine, but then I just broke down and started to cry.  Elizabeth Warren: ( 01:44:14 ) I had tried holding it all together, but without reliable childcare, working was nearly impossible. And when I told Aunt Bee I was going to quit my job, I thought my heart would break. And then she said, the words that changed my life. “I can’t get there tomorrow, but I’ll come on Thursday.” And she arrived with seven suitcases and a Pekinese named Buddy and stayed for 16 years. I get to be here tonight because of my aunt Bee. I learned a fundamental truth, nobody makes it on their own. And yet here we are two generations of working parents later, and if you have a baby and don’t have an Aunt Bee, you’re on your own. Here’s why that is wrong, we build infrastructure like roads and bridges and communication systems so that people can work. That infrastructure helps us all because it keeps our economy going.  Elizabeth Warren: ( 01:45:15 ) It’s time to recognize that childcare is part of the basic infrastructure of this nation. It’s infrastructure for families, Joe and Kamala will make high quality childcare affordable for every family, make pre-school universal and raise the wages of every childcare worker. Now that’s just one plan, but it gives you an idea of how we get this country working for everyone. Donald Trump’s ignorance and incompetence have always been a danger to our country. COVID-19 was Trump’s biggest test. He failed miserably. Today, America has the most COVID deaths in the world and an economic collapse, and both crises are falling hardest on black and brown families.  Elizabeth Warren: ( 01:46:07 ) Millions out of work, millions more are trapped in cycles of poverty, millions on the brink of losing their homes, millions of restaurants and stores hanging by a thread. This crisis is bad and it didn’t have to be this way. This crisis is on Donald Trump and the Republicans who enable him. On November 3rd, we will hold them all accountable. So, whether you’re planning to vote wearing a mask or vote by mail, please take out your phone right now and text Vote to 30330. We all need to be in the fight to get Joe and Kamala elected. And after November, we all need to stay in the fight to get big things done. We stay in this fight so that when our children and our grandchildren ask what we did during this dark chapter in our nation’s history, we will be able to look them squarely in the eye and say, “We organized, we persisted and we changed America.”  Kerry Washington: ( 01:47:25 ) Former president Barack Obama has said that choosing Joe Biden to be his vice president was one of the best decisions he ever made. And this is a man who has made a lot of good decisions, making healthcare more affordable and accessible, rescuing our economy, protecting American jobs, marrying Michelle Obama and through it all, Joe Biden was by his side, except for maybe marrying Michelle. You can witness their mutual respect and affection in this clip, take a look.  Barack Obama: ( 01:47:58 ) So Joe, for your faith in your fellow Americans, for your love of country and for your lifetime of service that will endure through the generations, I’d like to ask the military aid to join us on stage. For the final time as president, I am pleased to award our nation’s highest civilian honor, the presidential medal of freedom. For the first and only time in my presidency, I will bestow this medal with an additional level of veneration and honor my three most recent successors reserved for only three others. Pope John Paul II, President Ronald Reagan and General Colin Powell. Ladies and gentlemen, I am proud to award the Presidential Medal of Freedom with distinction to my brother, Joseph Robinette Biden Jr. Will the aid please read the citation.  Speaker 41: ( 01:49:47 ) Vice-president Joseph R. Biden Jr. In a career of public service spanning nearly half a century Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has left his mark on almost every part of our nation. Fighting for a stronger middle class, a fair judicial system and a smarter foreign policy. Providing unyielding support for our troops, combating crime and violence against women, leading our quest to cure cancer and safeguarding the landmark American recovery and Reinvestment Act from corruption. With his charm, candor, unabashed optimism and deep and abiding patriotism, Joe Biden has garnered the respect and esteem of colleagues of both parties and the friendship of people across the nation and around the world while summoning the strength, faith and grace to overcome great personal tragedy.  Speaker 41: ( 01:50:41 ) This son of Scranton, Claymont and Wilmington has become one of the most consequential vice-presidents in American history. And accolade that nonetheless rest firmly behind his legacy as husband, father, and grandfather. A grateful nation thanks Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. for his lifetime of service on behalf of the United States of America.  Barack Obama: ( 01:51:33 ) Good evening everybody, as you’ve seen by now, this isn’t a normal convention. It’s not a normal time. So tonight I want to talk as plainly as I can about the stakes in this election, because what we do these next 76 days will echo through generations to come. I’m in Philadelphia, where our constitution was drafted and signed, and it wasn’t a perfect document. It allowed for the inhumanity of slavery and failed to guarantee women and even men who didn’t own property, the right to participate in the political process. But embedded in this document was a north star that would guide future generations. A system of representative government, a democracy through which we could better realize our highest ideals. Through civil war and bitter struggles, we improved this constitution to include the voices of those who’d once been left out and gradually we made this country more just and more equal and more free.  Barack Obama: ( 01:52:53 ) The one constitutional office elected by all of the people is the presidency. So at a minimum, we should expect a president to feel a sense of responsibility for the safety and welfare of all 330 million of us, regardless of what we look like, how we worship, who we love, how much money we have or who we voted for. But we should also expect a president to be the custodian of this democracy. We should expect that regardless of ego, ambition or political beliefs, the president will preserve, protect and defend the freedoms and ideals that so many Americans marched for, went to jail for, fought for and died for.  Barack Obama: ( 01:53:46 ) I have sat in The Oval Office with both of the men who are running for president. I never expected that my successor would embrace my vision or continue my policies. I did help for the sake of our country that Donald Trump might show some interest in taking the job seriously, that he might come to feel the weight of the office and discover some reverence for the democracy that had been placed in his care, but he never did. For close to four years now he has shown no interest in putting in the work, no interest in finding common ground, no interest in using the awesome power of his office to help anyone but himself and his friends. No interest in treating the presidency as anything but one more reality show that he can use to get the attention he craves. Donald Trump hasn’t grown into the job because he can’t and the consequences of that failure are severe.  Barack Obama: ( 01:54:58 ) 170, 000 Americans dead, millions of jobs gone. Well, those are the top taken more than ever. Our worst impulses unleashed, our proud reputation around the world badly diminished and our democratic institutions threatened like never before. Now I know that in times as polarized as these, most of you have already made up your mind, but maybe you’re still not sure which candidate you’ll vote for or whether you’ll vote at all. Maybe you’re tired of the direction we’re headed, but you can’t see a better path yet or you just don’t know enough about the person who wants to lead us there.  Barack Obama: ( 01:55:54 ) So let me tell you about my friend Joe Biden. 12 years ago, when I began my search for a vice president, I didn’t know I’d ended up finding a brother. Joe and I come from different places, different generations, but what I quickly came to admire about Joe Biden is his resilience, born of too much struggle. His empathy, born a too much grief. Joe is a man who learned early on to treat every person he meets with respect and dignity. Living by the words his parents taught him. No one’s better than you, Joe, but you’re better than nobody.  Barack Obama: ( 01:56:42 ) That empathy, that decency, the belief that everybody counts, that’s who Joe is. When he talks with someone who’s lost her job, Joe remembers the night his father sat him down to say that he’d lost his. When Joe listens to a parent who’s trying to hold it all together right now, he does it as a single dad who took the train back to Wilmington each and every night so he could take his kids into bed. When he meets with military families who’ve lost bear hero, he does it as a kindred spirit. The parent of an American soldier. Somebody whose faith has endured the hardest loss there is. For eight years, Joe was the last one in the room whenever I faced a big decision. He made me a better president and he’s got the character and the experience to make us a better country.  Barack Obama: ( 01:57:48 ) And in my friend Kamala Harris, he’s chosen ideal partner who is more than prepared for the job. Someone who knows what it’s like to overcome barriers and who’s made a career fighting to help others live out their own American dream. Along with the experience needed to get things done, Joe and Kamala have concrete policies that will turn their vision of a better, fairer, stronger country into reality. They will get this pandemic under control like Joe did when he helped me manage H1N1 and prevent an Ebola outbreak from reaching our shores. They’ll expand healthcare to more Americans like Joe and I did 10 years ago when he helped craft the Affordable Care Act and nail down the votes to make it the law.  Barack Obama: ( 01:58:41 ) They’ll rescue the economy like Joe helped me do after the great recession. I asked him to manage the Recovery Act, which jump-started the longest stretch of job growth in history. And he sees this moment now, not as a chance to get back to where we were, but to make long overdue changes so that our economy actually makes life a little easier for everybody. Whether it’s the waitress trying to raise a kid on her own or the shift worker, always on the edge of getting laid off or the student figuring out how to pay for next semester’s classes. Joe and Kamala will restore our standing in the world. And as we’ve learned from this pandemic that matters.  Barack Obama: ( 01:59:26 ) Joe knows the world and the world knows him. He knows that our true strength comes from setting an example that the world wants to follow, a nation that stands with democracy, not dictators. A nation that can inspire and mobilize others to overcome threats like climate change and terrorism, poverty, and disease. But more than anything, what I know about Joe, what I know about Kamala, is that they actually care about every American and that they care deeply about this democracy. They believe that in a democracy, the right to vote is sacred and we should be making it easier for people to cast their ballots, not harder.  Barack Obama: ( 02:00:26 ) They believe that no one, including the president is above the law and that no public official, including the president should use their office to enrich themselves or their supporters. They understand that in this democracy, the commander-in-chief does not use the men and women of our military who are willing to risk everything to protect our nation as political props, to deploy against peaceful protestors on our own soil. They understand that political opponents aren’t American, just because they disagree with you, a free press isn’t the enemy but the way we hold officials accountable. That our ability to work together to solve big problems like a pandemic, depend on a fidelity to facts and science and logic and not just making stuff up.  Barack Obama: ( 02:01:29 ) None of this should be controversial. These shouldn’t be Republican principles or Democratic principles, they are American principles. But at this moment, this president and those who enable him have shown they don’t believe in these things. Tonight, I’m asking you to believe in Joe and Kamala’s ability to lead this country out of these dark times and build it back better. But here’s the thing, no single American can fix this country alone. Not even a president. Democracy was never meant to be transactional. You give me your vote, I make everything better. It requires an active and informed citizenry.  Barack Obama: ( 02:02:22 ) So I’m also asking you to believe in your own ability to embrace your own responsibility as citizens, to make sure that the basic tenants of our democracy endure because that’s what’s at stake right now, our democracy. Look, I understand why a lot of Americans are down on government. The way the rules have been set up and abused in Congress make it easier for special interests to stop progress than to make progress. Believe me, I know it. I understand why a white factory worker who’s seen his wages cut whereas jobs shipped overseas might feel like the government no longer looks out for him and why a black mom might feel like it never looked out for her at all.  Barack Obama: ( 02:03:18 ) I understand why a new immigrant might look around this country and wonder whether there’s still a place for him here. Why a young person might look at politics right now, the circus of it all, the meanness and the lies and conspiracy theories, and think, “What is the point?” Well, here’s the point, this president and those in power, those who benefit from keeping things the way they are, they are counting on your cynicism. They know they can’t win you over with their policies. So they’re hoping to make it as hard as possible for you to vote and to convince you that your vote does not matter. That is how they win. That is how they get to keep making decisions that affect your life and the lives of the people you love. That’s how the economy will keep getting skewed to the wealthy and well connected. How our health systems will let more people fall through the cracks.  Barack Obama: ( 02:04:28 ) That’s how a democracy withers until it’s no democracy at all. And we cannot let that happen. Do not let them take away your power. Do not let them take away your democracy. Make a plan right now for how you are going to get involved and vote. Do it as early as you can and tell your family and friends how they can vote too. Do what Americans have done for over two centuries when faced with even tougher times than this. All those quiet heroes who found the courage to keep marching, keep pushing in the face of hardship and injustice. Last month, we lost a giant of American democracy in John Lewis, and some years ago, I sat down with John and a few remaining leaders of the early civil rights movement.  Barack Obama: ( 02:05:33 ) One of them told me he never imagined he’d walk into the White House and see a president who looked like his grandson. And then he told me that he had it up and it turned out that on the very day that I was born, he was marching into a jail cell, trying to end Jim Crow segregation in the South. What we do echoes through generations, whatever our backgrounds. We are all the children of Americans who fought the good fight, great grandparents working in fire trips and sweatshops without rights or representation, farmers losing their dreams to dust, Irish and Italians and Asians and Latinos told, “Go back where you come from.” Jews and Catholics, Muslims and Sikhs made to feel suspect for the way they worshiped. Black Americans, chained and whipped and hanged, spit on for trying to sit at lunch counters, beaten for trying to vote.  Barack Obama: ( 02:06:57 ) If anyone had a right to believe that this democracy did not work and could not work, it was those Americans, our ancestors. They were on the receiving end of a democracy that had fallen short all their lives. They knew how far the daily reality of America strayed from the middle, and yet instead of giving up, they joined together and they said, “Somehow, some way we are going to make this work. We are going to bring those words in our founding documents to life.” I have seen that same spirit rising these past few years, folks of every age and background who packed city centers and airports and rural roads so that families wouldn’t be separated, so that another classroom wouldn’t get shot up, so that our kids won’t grow up on an uninhabitable planet.  Barack Obama: ( 02:08:12 ) Americans of all races joining together to declare in the face of injustice, and brutality at the hands of the state, that Black Lives Matter no more, but no less. So that no child in this country feels the continuing sting of racism To the young people who led us this summer, telling us we need to be better, in so many ways you are this country’s dreams fulfilled. Earlier generations had to be persuaded that everyone has equal worth. For you, it’s a given, a conviction and what I want you to know is that for all its messiness and frustrations, your system of self government can be harnessed to help you realize those convictions for all of us.  Barack Obama: ( 02:09:23 ) You can give our democracy new meaning. You can take it to a better place. You’re the missing ingredient, the ones who will decide whether or not America becomes the country that fully lives up to its creep. That work will continue long after this election, but any chance of success depends entirely on the outcome of this election. This administration has shown it will tear our democracy down if that’s what it takes for them to win. So we have to get busy building it up by pouring all our efforts into these 76 days and by voting like never before for Joe and Kamala and candidates up and down the ticket so that we leave no doubt about what this country that we love stands for today and for all our days to come. Stay safe. God bless.  Kerry Washington: ( 02:10:49 ) Thank you, President Obama. Thank you for your brilliant leadership. Joe Biden has chosen an extraordinary woman to be his running mate. Kamala Harris is a fighter and a trailblazer using her groundbreaking ideas to protect families and keep them together by reducing recidivism. I am so thrilled for her to become the vice president of the United States. Now please welcome our convention chair, Congressmen… (silence)  Speaker 42: ( 02:12:59 ) … family.  Meena Harris: ( 02:13:00 ) You showed me the importance of public service and made sure I grew up surrounded by smart, strong, ambitious women every day.  Maya Harris: ( 02:13:10 ) Growing up, having helped the poor kid who picked on me because my big sister would be there in a flash ready to have my back. Well, now we’ve got your back as you and Joe fight to protect our democracy.  Speaker 42: ( 02:13:23 ) And there’s no union more perfect than the one that brings us all to your kitchen table every Sunday night for stir fry, fry the chicken or spaghetti and meatball family dinners.  Meena Harris: ( 02:13:34 ) And now that I’m a mom, you’re showing my daughters and so many girls around the world who look like them, what’s possible and what it’s like to move through the world as fierce, formidable, phenomenal women in their own unique way.  Maya Harris: ( 02:13:49 ) I love you, I admire you, I am so proud of you. And even though mommy’s not here to see her first daughter step into history, the entire nation will see in your strength, your integrity, your intelligence, and your optimism, the values that she raised us with.  Speaker 42: ( 02:14:10 ) We love you, Mamala.  Meena Harris: ( 02:14:11 ) We’re so proud of you, auntie.  Maya Harris: ( 02:14:14 ) You mean the world to us Kamala.  Speaker 42: ( 02:14:16 ) And we could not be more excited.  Meena Harris: ( 02:14:18 ) To share you with the world.  Maya Harris: ( 02:14:20 ) As the next.  Meena Harris: ( 02:14:21 ) As the next.  Speaker 42: ( 02:14:22 ) Vice president.  Maya Harris: ( 02:14:23 ) Vice president of United.  Meena Harris: ( 02:14:25 ) States.  Speaker 43: ( 02:14:32 ) Joe Biden has selected Kamala Harris as his running mate.  Speaker 44: ( 02:14:35 ) She was the first black woman, first South Asian woman to be named on the Democratic ticket.  Speaker 45: ( 02:14:40 ) This is an historic pick…  Speaker 46: ( 02:14:40 ) What?  Speaker 47: ( 02:14:40 ) [inaudible 02:14:41].  Speaker 48: ( 02:14:42 ) Someone who looks like us on a presidential ticket. That’s crazy.  Speaker 49: ( 02:14:47 ) Kamala Harris is us. She was born in Oakland.  Speaker 50: ( 02:14:52 ) The daughter of immigrants.  Speaker 51: ( 02:14:55 ) The daughter of Shyamala.  Maya Harris: ( 02:14:59 ) Big sister and protector.  Speaker 52: ( 02:15:01 ) She is an HBCU grad.  Speaker 53: ( 02:15:05 ) She is a woman of many firsts.  Speaker 54: ( 02:15:10 ) [foreign language 00:33:09].  Speaker 55: ( 02:15:12 ) She’s a hard worker, a really hard worker.  Speaker 56: ( 02:15:15 ) She’s brilliant, she’s smart, she’s talkative and she’s got a big future.  Speaker 57: ( 02:15:24 ) She’s probably one of the best role models.  Speaker 58: ( 02:15:24 ) Kamala Harris is like a dream to me.  Speaker 59: ( 02:15:25 ) Senator Harris cares about people. There’s no doubt about her.  Speaker 60: ( 02:15:29 ) What she says for the people [inaudible 02:15:30] every ounce of who she is. She is for us, she’s for us.  Speaker 61: ( 02:15:37 ) She fights for women’s rights.  Speaker 62: ( 02:15:39 ) She finds to end mass incarceration.  Speaker 63: ( 02:15:42 ) She has a fearless advocate for the voiceless.  Speaker 64: ( 02:15:45 ) The litmus test for America is how we are treating black women.  Speaker 65: ( 02:15:49 ) Now I’m talking about someone who can fight for black people, brown people, undocumented, LGBT people, disabled people, young people, old people, all of America.  Kamala Harris: ( 02:16:01 ) It’s about all of us knowing our power can…  Kamala Harris: ( 02:16:03 ) … America. It’s about all of us knowing our power to each of us to live people up, right? And to remind them that we see them and we hear them and that they matter. Are you going to be vice president of the United States?  Kamala Harris: ( 02:16:51 ) Greetings America. It is truly an honor to be speaking with you tonight, that I am here tonight as a Testament to the dedication of generations before me. Women and men who believed so fiercely in the promise of equality, liberty, and justice for all.  Kamala Harris: ( 02:17:13 ) This week marks the 100th anniversary of the passage of the 19th Amendment, and we celebrate the women who fought for that right, yet so many of the black women who helped secure that victory were still prohibited from voting long after its ratification, but they were undeterred without fanfare or recognition they organized and testified and rallied and marched and fought, not just for their vote but for a seat at the table.  Kamala Harris: ( 02:17:47 ) These women and the generations that followed worked to make democracy and opportunity real in the lives of all of us who followed. They paved the way for the trail blazing leadership of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. And these women inspired us to pick up the torch and fight on women like Mary Church Terrell, Mary McLeod Bethune, Fannie Lou Hamer, and Diane Nash, Constance Baker Motley, and the great Shirley Chisholm. We’re not often taught their stories but as Americans, we all stand on their shoulders.  Kamala Harris: ( 02:18:40 ) And there’s another woman whose name isn’t known, whose story isn’t shared. Another woman whose shoulders I stand on, and that’s my mother Shyamala Gopalan Harris. She came here from India at age 19 to pursue her dream of curing cancer. At the University of California, Berkeley she met my father, Donald Harris, who had come from Jamaica to study economics.  Kamala Harris: ( 02:19:11 ) They fell in love in that most American way while marching together for justice in the civil rights movement of the 1960s. In the streets of Oakland and Berkeley, I got a strollers eye view of people getting into what the great John Lewis called good trouble. When I was five, my parents split and my mother raised us mostly on her own. Like so many mothers, she worked around the clock to make it work packing lunches before we woke up and paying bills after we went to bed, helping us with homework at the kitchen table and shuttling us to church for choir practice.  Kamala Harris: ( 02:19:53 ) She made it look easy though it never was. My mother instilled in my sister Maya and me, the values that we chart, the course of our lives. She raised us to be proud strong black women, and she raised us to know and be proud of our Indian heritage. She taught us to put family first, the family you’re born into and the family you choose.  Kamala Harris: ( 02:20:26 ) Family is my husband Doug, who I met on a blind date set up by my best friend. Family is our beautiful children, Cole and Ella who call me Mamala. Family is my sister. Family is my best friend, my nieces and my godchildren. Family is my uncles, my aunts, and my kitties. Family is Mrs. Shelton, my second mother who lived two doors down and helped raise me. Family is my beloved Alpha Kappa Alpha, our Divine 9, and my HBCU brothers and sisters. Family is the friends I turn to when my mother, the most important person in my life passed away from cancer. And even as she taught us to keep our family at the center of our world, she also pushed us to see a world beyond ourselves, she taught us to be conscious and compassionate about the struggles of all people, to believe public service is a noble cause and the fight for justice is a shared responsibility.  Kamala Harris: ( 02:21:48 ) That led me to become a lawyer, a district attorney, attorney general, and a United States Senator. And at every step of the way I’ve been guided by the words I spoke from the first time I stood in a courtroom. Kamala Harris for the people. I have fought for children and survivors of sexual assault, I fought against transnational criminal organizations. I took on the biggest banks and help take down one of the biggest for-profit colleges. I know a predator when I see one. My mother taught me that service to others gives life purpose and meaning, and oh, how I wish she were here tonight but I know she’s looking down on me from above. I keep thinking about that 25-year-old Indian woman, all of five feet tall who gave birth to me at Kaiser Hospital in Oakland, California. On that day, she probably could have never imagined that I would be standing before you now and speaking these words.  Kamala Harris: ( 02:23:07 ) I accept your nomination for vice president of the United States of America. I do so committed to the values she taught me, to the word that teaches me to walk by faith and not by sight, and to a vision passed on through generations of Americans one that Joe Biden shares. A vision of our nation as a beloved community, where all are welcome, no matter what we look like, no matter where we come from or who we love. A country where we may not agree on every detail, but we are United by the fundamental belief that every human being is of infinite worth, deserving of compassion, dignity, and respect.  Kamala Harris: ( 02:24:10 ) A country where we look out for one another, where we rise and fall as one, where we face our challenges and celebrate our triumphs together. Today, that country feels distant, Donald Trump’s failure of leadership has cost lives and livelihoods. If you’re a parent struggling with your child’s remote learning, or you’re a teacher struggling on the other side of that screen, you know what we’re doing right now is not working.  Kamala Harris: ( 02:24:54 ) And we are a nation that is grieving, grieving the loss of life, the loss of jobs, the loss of opportunities, the loss of normalcy, and yes, the loss of certainty. And while this virus touches us all, we got to be honest, it is not an equal opportunity offender, black, Latino, and indigenous people are suffering and dying disproportionately.  Kamala Harris: ( 02:25:32 ) And this is not a coincidence, it is the effect of structural racism of inequities in education and technology, healthcare and housing, job security and transportation, the injustice in reproductive and maternal health care, in the excessive use of force by police and in our broader criminal justice system. This virus, it has no eyes and yet it knows exactly how we see each other and how we treat each other.  Kamala Harris: ( 02:26:12 ) And let’s be clear, there is no vaccine for racism. We have got to do the work for George Floyd, for Brianna Taylor, for the lives of too many others to name, for our children and for all of us. We’ve got to do the work to fulfill that promise of equal justice under law. Because here’s the thing, none of us are free until all of us are free.  Kamala Harris: ( 02:26:53 ) So we’re at an inflection point, the constant chaos leaves us a drift. The incompetence makes us feel afraid. The callousness makes us feel alone. It’s a lot. And here’s the thing, we can do better and deserve so much more. We must elect a president who will bring something different, something better, and do the important work.  Kamala Harris: ( 02:27:31 ) A president who will bring all of us together, black, white, Latino, Asian, indigenous to achieve the future we collectively want. We must elect Joe Biden. And I will tell you, I knew Joe as vice president, I knew Joe on the campaign trail, and I first got to know Joe as the father of my friend. So Joe’s son Beau and I served as attorneys general of our states Delaware and California. During the great recession, he and I spoke on the phone nearly every day, working together to win back billions of dollars for homeowners from the big banks that foreclosed on people’s homes.  Kamala Harris: ( 02:28:25 ) And Beau and I, we would talk about his family. How as a single father, Joe would spend four hours every day riding the train back and forth from Wilmington to Washington. Beau and Hunter got to have breakfast every morning with their dad, they went to sleep every night with the sound of his voice, reading bedtime stories. And while they endured and unspeakable loss, those two little boys always knew that they were deeply unconditionally loved.  Kamala Harris: ( 02:29:03 ) And what also moved me about Joe is the work that he did as he was going back and forth. This is the leader who wrote the Violence Against Women Act, and enacted the Assault Weapons Ban. Who as vice president implemented the Recovery Act, which brought our country back from the great recessions. He championed the Affordable Care Act protecting millions of Americans with preexisting conditions, who spent decades promoting American values and interests around the world.  Kamala Harris: ( 02:29:41 ) Joe, he believes we stand with our allies and stand up to our adversaries. Right now, we have a president who turns our tragedies into political weapons. Joe will be a president who turns our challenges into purpose. Joe will bring us together to build an economy that doesn’t leave anyone behind, where a good paying job is the floor, not the ceiling.  Kamala Harris: ( 02:30:20 ) Joe will bring us together to end this pandemic and make sure that we are prepared for the next one. Joe will bring us together to squarely face and dismantle racial injustice, furthering the work of generations. Joe and I believe that we can build that beloved community. One that is strong and decent, just and kind, one in which we can all see ourselves. That’s the vision that our parents and grandparents fought for.  Kamala Harris: ( 02:31:04 ) The vision that made my own life possible. The vision that makes the American promise for all its complexities and imperfections, a promise worth fighting for. So make no mistake. The road ahead is not easy, we may stumble, we may fall short. But I pledge to you that we will act boldly and deal with our challenges honestly.  Kamala Harris: ( 02:31:37 ) We will speak truths and we will act with the same faith in you that we ask you to place in us. We believe that our country, all of us will stand together for a better future. And we already are, we see it in the doctors, the nurses, the home healthcare workers and frontline workers who are risking their lives to save people they’ve never met.  Kamala Harris: ( 02:32:08 ) We see it in the teachers and truck drivers, the factory workers and farmers, the postal workers and poll workers, all putting their own safety on the line to help us get through this pandemic. And we see it in so many of you who are working, not just to get us through our current crisis but to somewhere better.  Kamala Harris: ( 02:32:39 ) There’s something happening all across our country, it’s not about Joe or me, it’s about you and it’s about us, people of all ages and colors and creeds who are yes, taken to the streets and also persuading our family members, rallying our friends, organizing our neighbors and getting out the vote.  Kamala Harris: ( 02:33:09 ) And we have shown that when we vote, we expand access to healthcare and expand access to the ballot box, and ensure that more working families can make a decent living. And I’m so inspired by a new generation, you, you are pushing us to realize the ideals of our nation, pushing us to live the values we share decency and fairness, justice, and love.  Kamala Harris: ( 02:33:47 ) You are Patriots who remind us that to love our country is to fight for the ideals of our country. In this election, we have a chance to change the course of history, we’re all in this fight, you, me and Joe together. What an awesome responsibility, what an awesome privilege. So let’s fight with conviction, let’s fight with hope, let’s fight with confidence in ourselves and a commitment to each other.  Kamala Harris: ( 02:34:37 ) To the America we know is possible, the America we love. And years from now, this moment will have passed and our children, and our grandchildren will look in our eyes and they’re going to ask us, ” Where were you when the stakes were so high?” They will ask us, “What was it like?” And we will tell them, we will tell them not just how we felt, we will tell them what we did. Thank you. God bless you. And God bless the United States of America.  Speaker 66: ( 02:38:03 ) Thank you, Senator Harris. So powerful. To close out the night, we’ve got some amazing music from the incomparable, Jennifer Hudson, as well as some highlights from tonight. And then tomorrow we’ll hear from more Americans fighting for a more perfect union fighting for all of us.  Speaker 66: ( 02:38:18 ) And finally, Joe Biden will officially accept the nomination for president. I’ll be tuning in, I hope you will too. Thank you for letting me be a part of your night.  Speaker 66: ( 02:38:26 ) (singing)  Kamala Harris: ( 02:42:46 ) We must elect a president who will bring something different, something better, and do the important work. A president who will bring all of us together, black, white, Latino, Asian, indigenous to achieve the future we collectively want. We must elect Joe Biden.  Speaker 67: ( 02:43:14 ) He was there for me, he’ll be there for you too.  Speaker 68: ( 02:43:18 ) Remember back in 2016, when Trump asked, “What do you have to lose?” Well, now we know, our healthcare, our jobs, our loved ones, our leadership in the world and even our post office.  Nancy Pelosi: ( 02:43:33 ) We come together now not to decry the darkness but to light a way forward for our country.  Speaker 69: ( 02:43:39 ) The way I see it, big problems demand big solutions. Now I love a good plan. And Joe Biden has some really good plans.  Barack Obama: ( 02:43:49 ) But here’s the thing, no single American can fix this country alone, not even a president. Democracy was never meant to be transactional, you give me your vote I make everything better. It requires an active and informed citizenry. So I’m also asking you to believe in your own ability to embrace your own responsibility as citizens, to make sure that the basic tenants of our democracy endure.  Archbishop Elpidophoros: ( 02:44:24 ) Greetings. I am Archbishop Elpidophoros of the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America. Let us pray. Most merciful and loving God, as we gather in soberness of mind and of heart for the sake of our nation and its future, we pray that you would shine the light of your countenance upon the delegates of this convention and upon vice president Joe Biden for the highest office in the land. As we face the future as one American nation, bring us to our best selves and inspire our better angels in peace, in fairness, and in generosity. That we may fight against injustice, inequality, and hatred. That we may achieve a common good, a greater good in the name of the Holy Trinity, we pray. Amen.  Speaker 70: ( 02:45:33 ) That concludes our convention program for this evening. We will stand in recess until tomorrow evening.
