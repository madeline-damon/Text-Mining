Speaker 1: ( 27:54 ) A country where we are judged by our character, with dignity and respect for all. The belief that all are created equal, that lives matter irrespective of race, creed or color. Committed to excelling beyond our dreams, limited only by our imaginations, where rugged individualism and American exceptionalism inspire the best in each of us.  Speaker 2: ( 28:22 ) Liftoff.  Speaker 1: ( 28:24 ) And we see injustice to one, we act to fix it for all. This is our story we journey together. We stand in the breach to preserve a way of life that while imperfect, has brought prosperity, honor and dignity to generations past and will for generations to come. Four years ago, we faced a historic crossroad. Career politicians promising change every election, but delivering emptiness. We chose a different path, a man who is not a politician, a man who cares, a man who loves America and all Americans. A man who works tirelessly for you, even tonight during this nomination. The results? Jobs were created, embracing the undeniable greatness of diversity. Prosperity, safe communities, protecting and serving, caring for one another.  Speaker 1: ( 29:32 ) Still politicians spun their deceptions and obstructed progress, fanning the flames of lawlessness. We all know that it is easy to criticize. It takes a true leader to solve problems. COVID-19, while others criticized without solutions, President Trump’s swift action saved lives, and as leading Democrats want to keep businesses closed down, our president is leading the way for a full economic recovery. We are America, despite unpredictable events, we as Americans work together to overcome challenges, write our own stories. The legends for our posterity, America, land of promise, land of opportunity, land of heroes, land of greatness. Join us over the next four nights as we write the next chapter of our journey and share our vision as the greatest country with the greatest citizens that attain the greatest achievements.  Speaker 3: ( 30:53 ) From Washington, D.C., welcome to the 2020 Republican National Convention. Tonight, celebrating America as the land of promise.  Speaker 4: ( 31:22 ) Let us pray and pray we must as grateful citizens of a country we boldly claim to be one nation under God. Pray we must, praising the Lord for a country where freedom of religion is so cherished, where both Republicans and Democrats begin their conventions, heads bowed, in prayer. Pray we must, conscious of those suffering from COVID and those unwearied frontliners who care for them and all of us. Pray we must that all lives may be protected and respected, in our troubled cities and the police who guard them, in tense world situations where our men and women in uniform keep the peace, for the innocent life of the baby in the womb, for our elders in nursing care and hospice, for our immigrants and refugees, those lives threatened by religious persecution throughout the world or by plague, hunger, drugs, human trafficking or war. Pray we must in thanksgiving, in thanksgiving dear God for democracy as we ask your hand Almighty Father upon this convention and the nominees of both parties and His wisdom upon an electorate so eager to perform its duty of faithful citizenship. Pray we do, for we dare claim in God we trust. Amen.  Speaker 5: ( 33:10 ) I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.  Charlie Kirk: ( 33:32 ) Good evening. It is an honor to be with you tonight. My name is Charlie Kirk. I run the largest pro-American student organization in the country, Turning Point USA, fighting for the future of our republic. Speaking to you in my personal capacity tonight as a 26-year-old, I see the angst of young people as well as the challenges facing new parents. I am here tonight to tell you, to warn you, that this election is a decision between preserving America as we know it and eliminating everything that we love. For decades, ruling class leaders in both parties sold out our future to China, to faceless corporations, and to self-serving lobbyists. They did it to preserve their own power and enrich themselves, all while rigging the system to hold down the good, decent middle class patriots striving to build a family and pursue a decent life. All of this changed dramatically in 2015, when a billionaire named Donald Trump put his own life of luxury on the line. From that moment he came down that famous escalator, he started a movement to reclaim our government from the rotten cartel of insiders that have been destroying our country. We may not have realized it at the time, but Trump is the bodyguard of Western civilization. Trump was elected to protect our families from the vengeful mob –  Charlie Kirk: ( 35:03 ) … was elected to protect our families from the vengeful mob that seeks to destroy our way of life. Our neighborhoods, schools, churches, and values. President Trump was elected to defend the American way of life. The American way of life means you follow the law. You work hard, you honor God, you raise your kids with strong values and you work to create a civil society. The American way of life means you speak your mind without retribution, without being kicked off social media by a self-righteous censor in Silicon Valley. It means you can freely practice your religion and that church is more essential than a casino. And it means that we judge people on their actions, not on their immutable characteristics. The American way of life is being dismantled by a group of bitter, deceitful, vengeful, activists who have never built anything in their lives. They have us locking up pastors while releasing violent criminals from prison.  Charlie Kirk: ( 36:07 ) We are kicking doctors off of social media, yet promoting Chinese state funded propaganda on major tech platforms. This election is the most critical since 1860, when a man named Lincoln was elected to preserve the Union from disintegration. This election is not just the most important of our lifetime. It is the most important since the preservation of the Republic in 1865. By re-electing Trump, we will ensure that our kids are raised to love our country and respect its founding fathers, not taught to hate or be ashamed of them. We will build monuments to heroes, not burn down our cities. We’ll be a country that rises to higher heights, that dreams big, thinks big, and achieves the impossible. A country that values a remarkable journey, the complexities of our past, but clearly communicates to the next generation that we have to be grateful not angry that we live in the United States.  Charlie Kirk: ( 37:08 ) We will be a country that makes it easier to have many children, live quiet and peaceable lives, and worship your God without a tyrant getting in the way. We will be a country that has its best 100 years ahead. We will build a future where America remains the greatest country ever to exist in the history of the world. All of that is within our grasp if we secure four more years for the defender of Western civilization, our champion, my friend, the 45th President of the United States, President Donald J. Trump.  Rebecca Friedrichs: ( 37:58 ) I’m Rebecca Friedrichs, a veteran California public school educator. I’m here to give voice to America’s great teachers because our voices have been silenced for decades by unions who claim to represent us. They do not. When other dedicated teachers and I served within the unions, we spoke up in defense of children, parents, scientific fact and American values. For our trouble, we were brutalized, booed off the platform, barred from committees, shouted down and even spit upon by union leaders. This is how unions treat devoted teachers, but what’s even worse is how their agenda of control deceives Americans and our children. They’ve intentionally rewritten American history to perpetuate division, pervert the memories of our American founders and disparage our Judeo-Christian virtues. They’re lenient discipline policies morphed our schools into war zones and they back defunding police and abolishing ICE. Unions collect billions annually from unsuspecting teachers and push this radical agenda into our classrooms against our will. Why?  Rebecca Friedrichs: ( 39:23 ) The only way to keep a free republic is with a well-educated moral citizenry that can self- govern. Unions are subverting our republic, so they undermine educational excellence, morality, law and order. That’s why they spend hundreds of millions annually to defeat charter schools and school choice. Trapping so many precious, low-income children in dangerous, corrupt, and low-performing schools. To fight back on behalf of children and America, brave teachers brought a lawsuit against unions. And do you know who intervened against us? The Obama, Biden administration and California Attorney General Kamala Harris. They argued against us at the U.S. Supreme Court. Their comrades labeled us spawns of Satan and slandered us in mainstream media. No matter their abuse, we’ll keep fighting for the country and children we love just like President Trump. He’s breaking the union’s grip on our schools. That’s why unions have tried to destroy him since the day he was elected. But President Trump isn’t afraid to fight for what’s right. He won’t back down. His courage gives great teachers renewed hope.  Rebecca Friedrichs: ( 40:49 ) He’s even proposed education freedom scholarships to return control to parents, protect religious liberties and empower kids to escape dangerous, low-performing schools. The Republican platform supports educational freedom. The Democrat Party does not. Democrats stand with deceptive teachers unions who pick on loving teachers and little kids. President Trump stands with America’s families, great teachers, and most importantly, our children. So America’s great teachers, let’s stand with President Trump in protection of the kids and country we love.  Tanya Weinreis: ( 41:45 ) So grateful to speak with you today. My name is Tanya Weinreis. I am from Montana where I live with my husband, my hero, a Marine and retired police officer. My husband and I own Mountain Mudd Espresso. We are not some multinational corporation. Our success is not measured by stockholders but by our neighbors, the people we see at church and at jujitsu school with our son. Mountain Mudd Espresso is the American story. A story not just for entrepreneurs but for millions of hardworking men and women who are building their American dream every day. A few months ago like so many businesses, we got the crushing news, a large event we were serving was canceled because of the virus. Our business was on the brink, threatened to be shut down from losses that were not our fault. I was scared. I thought of our 50 employees, the Mountain Mudd family.  Tanya Weinreis: ( 42:49 ) And when I thought of their jobs, I thought of their rent being due, their kids and I felt personally responsible. I’m not too proud to admit that I fell on my knees and prayed, Lord, what do I do? His words rang clear, keep on working, it will be okay. I had faith. And let me tell you, you have to have faith when your husband is a Marine and a police officer who was shot at on the job. And when you run a business, a little faith goes a long way. Faith in Jesus and faith in America. But I’m worried we have a generation of Americans who have been told that the American dream doesn’t exist. That’s a lie. I know because I live that dream. That’s why I feel so strongly that we need a president who believes in the American dream like President Donald Trump, now more than ever.  Tanya Weinreis: ( 43:47 ) I am so thankful that my prayers for help were answered. My company was one of the first to receive a PPP loan and praise God, it has been a lifesaver. Not only were we able to keep every single employee but we’ve been hiring weekly ever since. I feel for local businesses across America who are under assault from shutdowns, from riots, and now facing the terrifying prospect of Joe Biden coming after everything we’ve built. I am so grateful we have leaders like President Trump, standing up for local businesses like mine. Thank you, President Trump, it is exciting to be part of the great American comeback story.  Matt Gaetz: ( 44:48 ) I’m Congressman Matt Gaetz, I’m speaking to you from an auditorium emptier than Joe Biden’s daily schedule. But we are a nation of full hearts and clear minds. We see the choice clearly, strength or weakness, energy or confusion, success or failure. President Trump is the first president since Reagan not to start a new war. Biden has foolishly cheerled decades of war without winning, without end. President Trump knows we are strongest when we fight hardest, not in distant deserts, but for our fellow Americans. We must fight to save America now or we may lose her forever. Joe Biden might not even notice. Settle for Biden, that’s the hashtag promoted by AOC and the socialists. The woketopians will settle for Biden because they will make him an extra in a movie written, produced, and directed by others. It’s a horror film really. They’ll disarm you, empty the prisons, lock you in your home and invite MS-13 to live next door.  Matt Gaetz: ( 45:50 ) And the police aren’t coming when you call in Democrat run cities, they’re already being defunded, disbanded. Blaming our best and allowing society’s worst, that’s the story they write in Hollywood. That’s if the lights even stay on in California anymore, a state that cannot keep power running for its own people should not send its junior Senator to be vice president. They used to write only in fiction, but nightmares are becoming real. Cops killed, children shot. At the Democrat convention they say, if you vote against Trump, it will all stop. Appeasement is never a winning strategy. No, we won’t settle for violence in our neighborhoods or at our border. We won’t settle for decades of bad decisions by basement dwelling Joe Biden. We settle a continent. We know that the frontier, the horizon, even the stars belonged to us. Donald Trump like all builders is a visionary. That which is built in the mind is even more powerful than the brick and mortar that holds it together.  Matt Gaetz: ( 46:52 ) First comes the mind, then the making. First comes the vision, then the work. Washington, Lincoln, and Jefferson are immortal precisely because of the pull they have on our imagination. You cannot cancel a culture that loves its heroes. The dangerous left need America to be weaker to accomplish their goal of replacing her. We know that to make America great again, we must first make something of ourselves. That is the meaning of true strength. My great-grandfather was a railroad man. As a Florida man, I watch our rockets routinely send the brightest beyond the heavens with our flag and our hope. America is the greatest country that has ever existed. Don’t let any celebrity athlete or politician tell you otherwise.  Matt Gaetz: ( 47:39 ) President Trump sometimes raises his voice and a ruckus. He knows that’s what it takes to raise an army of patriots who love America and will protect her. We must win this election if we cherish our country as much as we should, for there is no place to run, no refuge for freedom should we fail. America is not just an idea or a constitution, it is our home. We must protect our home with unbreakable made in America strength. Strength I see every day in President Donald Trump. Thank you.  Kim Klacik: ( 48:17 ) My name is Kim Klacik and I’m running for Congress in Maryland’s seventh district. And like Shirley Chisholm, I’m unbought and unbossed. Let me remind you, the Democrats have controlled this part of Baltimore City for over 50 years and they run this beautiful place right into the ground. Abandoned buildings, liquor stores on every corner, drug addicts, guns on the street, that’s now the norm in many neighborhoods. You think Maryland taxpayers would be getting a whole lot since our taxes are out of control, instead we’re paying for decades of incompetence and corruption. Sadly, the same cycle of decay exists in many of America’s Democrat run cities. And yet the Democrats still assume that black people will vote for them. No matter how much they let us down and take us for granted. We’re sick of it. We’re not going to take it anymore. The days of blindly supporting the Democrats are coming to an end.  Kim Klacik: ( 49:07 ) In Baltimore, we had the highest number of black Republicans in the entire country running for office this election cycle. Joe Biden believes we can’t think for ourselves, that the color of someone’s skin dictates their political views. We’re not buying the lies anymore. You and your party have neglected us for far too long. We want safety in our neighborhoods. We want to make the most of the federal opportunity zone I’m standing in right now in West Baltimore. We want higher paying jobs and more business opportunities. We want lower taxes. We want school choice. We want a chance to get ahead, not just get by. That’s what President Trump promised and that’s what President Trump delivered. I want Baltimore to be an example to republicans around the country that we can compete in our inner cities if we reach out to the citizens and deliver real results.  Kim Klacik: ( 49:56 ) President Trump is bringing this country back roaring. He’s bringing the American spirit to life for all Americans. So I’m asking you to help President Trump complete this great American comeback. And then I’m asking you to help me start this great Baltimore come back. Thank you and God bless America.  Ronna McDaniel: ( 50:30 ) Good evening. I’m Ronna McDaniel, chairwoman of the Republican National Committee and on behalf of everyone in our party and President Trump, thank you for tuning in as we kick off this historic convention. As we speak to you tonight, we send our thoughts and prayers to those facing terrible fires in California, recovering from storms in Iowa, and preparing for hurricanes in Louisiana and the Gulf Coast. Democrats started their convention last week with Eva Longoria, a famous Hollywood actress who played a housewife on T.V. Well, I’m actually a real housewife and a mom from Michigan with two wonderful kids in public school, who happens to be only the second woman in 164 years to run the Republican party.  Ronna McDaniel: ( 51:23 ) And unlike Joe Biden, President Trump didn’t choose me because I’m a woman, he chose me because I was the best person for the job. Four years ago, President Trump started a movement unlike any other. And over the next four days, we will hear from a few of the millions of hardworking everyday Americans who have benefited from his leadership. If you watched the DNC last week, you probably noticed that Democrats spent a lot of time talking about how much they despise our president. But we heard very little about their actual policies. Policies that would have been unthinkable a decade ago. Policies like banning fossil fuels, eliminating private health insurance, taxpayer funded healthcare for people who come here illegally and defunding the police.  Ronna McDaniel: ( 52:17 ) Their argument for Joe Biden boiled down to the fact that they think he’s a nice guy. Well, let me tell you, raising taxes on 82% of Americans is not nice. Eliminating 10 million good paying oil and gas jobs is not nice. Policies that force jobs to flee our country or allow abortion up until the point of birth are not nice. The truth is, there’s only one person who has empathized with everyday Americans and actually been fighting for them over the past four years and that is President Donald Trump. In the nearly four years I’ve worked on behalf of President Trump, I’ve seen up close a man who has a deep love for family. A man who has reverence for the office of the presidency. A man with an incredible respect for law enforcement and our military. I’ve seen private moments where he comforts Americans in times of pain and sadness.  Ronna McDaniel: ( 53:20 ) Now everyone knows he can be tough. He’s tough when he takes on China. Tough when he works to fix our unfair trade deals. Tough when he fights to secure our borders. President Trump is always going to be tough when he is fighting for the American people because nice guys like Joe cared more about countries like China and Iran than the United States of America. Tonight begins a new chapter in the great American story, a story that has inspired the world for generations. And when we re-elect President Trump this November, the best is yet to come. This election is the most important in our lifetime. Your vote counts more than ever. If you want to check your voting status, secure your ballot, or register to vote, text vote to 8-8-0-2-2. Earlier today, President Trump and Vice President Pence came to North Carolina to thank our delegates for unanimously re-nominating them to a second term.  Ronna McDaniel: ( 54:28 ) Our official roll call and the business of our Republican convention was conducted today in Charlotte. We have created a short video to symbolize the excitement for President Trump across all 50 states and territories. Thank you for watching. God bless you and God bless the United States of America.

Speaker 12: ( 55:39 ) We’re excited to nominate …  Speaker 62: ( 55:40 ) Donald J. Trump …  Speaker 36: ( 55:42 ) And Vice President Mike Pence …  Speaker 45: ( 55:44 ) For four more years.  Speaker 63: ( 55:45 ) Thank you for all you’ve done to make America great again.  Speaker 64: ( 55:49 ) It is our privilege …  Speaker 21: ( 55:51 ) To nominate you for four more years.  Speaker 52: ( 55:53 ) And we know the best is yet to come.  Speaker 65: ( 55:55 ) Trump 2020!  Speaker 50: ( 55:55 ) Trump, Trump, Trump!  Speaker 66: ( 56:03 ) Four more years!  Speaker 67: ( 56:03 ) Four more years!  Speaker 68: ( 56:03 ) Four more years! Four more years!1  Speaker 69: ( 56:03 ) Four more years! Four more years!  Speaker 51: ( 56:03 ) Four more years! Four more years!  Speaker 25: ( 56:03 ) Four more years! Four more years!  Speaker 70: ( 56:08 ) Four more years! Four more years!  Donald Trump: ( 56:41 ) We will make America great again. And ladies and gentlemen of this country, the best is yet to come. I didn’t back down from my promises and I’ve kept every single one.  Speaker 71: ( 57:12 ) This current administration had made hope possible.  Speaker 72: ( 57:19 ) We want this nation to continue to be the beacon of hope for the world.  Speaker 73: ( 57:26 ) How many people say they’re going to leave America if Donald Trump was elected, they’re all still here. And they’re not going anywhere because we are in the land of the free.  Donald Trump: ( 57:35 ) We will never, ever sign bad trade deals. America first, again, America first.  Speaker 74: ( 57:43 ) America’s great USMCA trade deal.  Speaker 75: ( 57:46 ) This a big win for the United States of America. This is a great trade deal.  Donald Trump: ( 57:49 ) We are going to lift the restrictions on the production of American energy. We will create millions of more jobs.  Speaker 76: ( 57:58 ) [inaudible 00:57:58] is the belief in a better tomorrow and creating a better future for our children.  Speaker 77: ( 58:05 ) When I look in the eyes of my grandchildren, I want them to know that their papa was not silent.  Donald Trump: ( 58:11 ) We will rescue kids from failing schools by helping their parents send them to a safe school of their choice. We will completely rebuild our depleted military. The countries that we are protecting at a massive cost to us will be asked to pay their fair share. We will take care of our great veterans like they have never been taken care of before.  Speaker 78: ( 58:48 ) This guy saved me, he saved me. Thanks to him, I’m here.  Speaker 79: ( 58:57 ) To me, he’s giving people hope. What he’s doing for the poor people, what he’s doing for everybody.  Donald Trump: ( 59:05 ) We are going to appoint justices of the United States Supreme Court who will uphold our laws and our constitution.  Speaker 80: ( 59:18 ) By supporting law enforcement is so important for keeping America great.  Donald Trump: ( 59:20 ) As long as I’m president, I will never defund your police, that I promise you. It’s time to deliver a victory for the American people. We are going to start winning again. It’s called promises made, promises kept.  Amy Ford: ( 59:40 ) My name is Amy Ford. I’ve been a registered nurse for 17 years. I’m from the small town of Williamson, West Virginia, where I’ve lived my entire life, the daughter of a nurse and a coal miner. Even though I was the youngest of four children, I was always somewhat of a caretaker. It came natural for me. So it felt right to follow in my mother’s footsteps and become a nurse. And this March, when COVID-19 send our country into crisis, I knew I had to help any way that I could. I deployed to New York in April and then to San Antonio, Texas working as a COVID relief nurse in both states. As I continued with the challenges of treating our patients who had their worlds turned upside down, I noticed a positive change in our healthcare system. President Trump recognized the threat this virus presented for all Americans early on and made rapid policy changes.  Amy Ford: ( 01:00:50 ) And as a result, tele-health services are now accessible to more than 71 million Americans, including 35 million children. Prior to COVID, tele-health was not covered or reimbursed under Medicare, Medicaid, or CHIP. This left our most vulnerable populations with no other choice but to have an in-person office visit with their physicians, increasing their risk of exposure to COVID-19 exponentially. The expansion of tele-health services has also resulted in the integration of video visits between patients and their families. Allowing loved ones to have contact and visualization, as well as a better understanding of care. Tele-health has been essential during this pandemic. I don’t want the media taking my personal story and twisting it, so let me be clear. As a healthcare professional, I can tell you without hesitation Donald Trump’s quick action and leadership saved thousands of lives during COVID-19.  Amy Ford: ( 01:01:57 ) And the benefits of that response extend far beyond coronavirus. Tele-health will continue to aid many that are just unable to find transportation or way to the doctor for regular checkups. This is especially true in rural America. I live in a town of about 2,000 people. We do not have buses, trains, trolleys, or Uber’s available to us. In addition, the unavailability of services can also hinder treatment for many. So increased access to tele-health from millions of Americans has truly been life-saving and we have President Trump to thank.  Narrator: ( 01:02:39 ) From the very beginning, Democrats, the media, and the World Health Organization got coronavirus wrong. The World Health Organization said authorities have found no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission.  John Torres: ( 01:02:53 ) Overall, most people should not be terribly concerned about it.  Nancy Pelosi: ( 01:02:56 ) Everything is fine here. We do want to say to people, come to Chinatown, here we are, come join us.  Andrew Cuomo: ( 01:03:03 ) We don’t even think it’s going to be as bad as it was other countries.  Bill de Blasio: ( 01:03:07 ) Go about your lives, go about your business.  Narrator: ( 01:03:10 ) One leader took decisive action to save lives, President Donald Trump. Banning travel from China and coronavirus epicenters, Biden charged xenophobia. But President Trump was right, signing the CARES Act, providing immediate relief to American families, workers and businesses. Declaring a national emergency, tapping into 42 billion in existing emergency funding. Quickly getting crucial personal protective equipment to the states. Signing the Families First Coronavirus Response Act, ensuring that American families and businesses impacted by the virus receive the strong support they need. Launching Operation Warp Speed to fast track a vaccine in record time.  Gavin Newsom: ( 01:03:57 ) He said everything that I could have hoped for, promise made, promise kept.  Andrew Cuomo: ( 01:04:02 ) He is ready, willing, and able to help. He has been responsive. He’s done a lot of good things. What the federal government did was a phenomenal accomplishment.  Phil Murphy: ( 01:04:13 ) In our hour of need, you all literally are helping us in a big way. We were at the edge and this is life or death stuff and we’re forever thankful for that.  Narrator: ( 01:04:22 ) Soon we will emerge safer, stronger and greater than ever.  Dr. G.E. Ghali: ( 01:04:36 ) I’m Dr. G.E. Ghali, an oral and maxillofacial surgeon and chancellor of a large academic medical and research center in Louisiana. I feel uniquely positioned to share how President Trump’s decisive leadership led to a rapid and efficient response to the coronavirus pandemic. I know this as a health professional and as someone who has recovered from COVID himself. The COVID-19 pandemic exploded into our great nation with an intensity unparalleled in history. But our medical investigation and drug development systems were not designed for a pandemic. The devastating effects of the coronavirus demanded immediate changes at the regulatory level. A prompt response led by President Trump cleared away the red tape that usually makes drug approvals a long and drawn out process.  Dr. G.E. Ghali: ( 01:05:32 ) By harnessing the resources the federal government and the private sector, President Trump’s Operation Warp Speed is accelerating the testing, supply, development and distribution of therapeutics, diagnostics, and very shortly, effective vaccines to counter COVID-19. Let me give you three clear examples of how President Trump’s leadership removed regulatory barriers so COVID patients could have faster access to effective therapies and diagnostics. First on February 26, two phase three clinical trials studying remdesivir were initiated. Just two months later, the FDA approved remdesivir for emergency use to treat COVID-19. Normally this is a three to five year process. The amazing speed with which this happened in a safe but efficient manner is unheard of. Second, the FDA granted expanded access to COVID-19 convalescent plasma. Within 24 hours of this approval, we were administering convalescent plasma and remdesivir to a critically ill patient, a former Army ranger and physician.  Dr. G.E. Ghali: ( 01:06:52 ) Had it not been for the rapid deployment of these medicines, this patient who is my colleague and friend, would have surely died, And third, at the end of July, I developed a fever and cough. I reached out to our testing team and received one of the Abbott rapid tests, yet another tool quickly approved by this administration. Within 15 minutes, my test came back positive and within four hours I was receiving my remdesivir doses followed by an infusion of convalescent plasma. As a physician, I’ve seen firsthand how these breakthroughs have saved countless lives. As a patient I’ve benefited from the expedited therapies made by the swift action of this administration. President Trump truly moved mountains to save lives and he deserves credit. Thank you President Trump for providing timely access to critical diagnostics and therapeutics during this pandemic. Thank you Mr. President for your strong leadership in these challenging times.  Donald Trump: ( 01:08:07 ) When the China virus invaded our country, we launched the greatest mobilization of American society since World War II. Patriots of every race, color, and creed rallied together to defeat the invisible enemy and save the lives of their fellow citizens. Today, our hearts overflow with appreciation for the incredible frontline workers who risked their own health and safety to keep America strong and safe. When crisis came, millions of everyday Americans rose to the challenge. In their actions, we see true greatness of the American character. We always find a way to victory. History will remember and celebrate the heroes of 2020 for as long as our great American flag waves over the land that we love. To every frontline worker, I offer the salute of a nation that is forever in your debt. Thank you, God bless you and God bless America.  Donald Trump: ( 01:09:10 ) These are my friends, these are the incredible workers that helped us so much with the COVID. We can call it many different things, from China virus, I don’t want to go through all the names because some people may get insulted but that’s the way it is. These are great, great people, doctors, nurses, firemen, policemen, we want to thank you all. You have been incredible and we want to thank you and all of the millions of people that you represent. Thank you all very much. Great job. Thank you. Thank you all very much. So tell me a little about your stories. How about we’ll start with you.  Speaker 81: ( 01:09:44 ) I’m a postal worker, delivered to the senior community during COVID-19.  Donald Trump: ( 01:09:49 ) Good and we’re taking good care of our postal workers.  Speaker 81: ( 01:09:51 ) Absolutely.  Donald Trump: ( 01:09:52 ) That I can tell you. Believe me, we’re not getting rid of our postal workers, they’d like to sort of put that out there. If anyone does, it’s the Democrats, not the Republicans. I want to thank you very much and thank everybody.  President Trump: ( 01:10:03 ) … Democrats, not the Republicans. I want to thank you very much and thank everybody in that whole beautiful post office system. We appreciate it.  Speaker 82: ( 01:10:07 ) Thank you.  President Trump: ( 01:10:08 ) How about you?  Speaker 83: ( 01:10:08 ) I’m a trucker.  President Trump: ( 01:10:09 ) Good.  Speaker 83: ( 01:10:10 ) I own a small business in Ohio.  President Trump: ( 01:10:12 ) Great.  Speaker 83: ( 01:10:13 ) Hauling steel mostly. Some of our customers actually made hospital beds with some of the material.  President Trump: ( 01:10:18 ) Oh wow, that’s fantastic. Well, congratulations. I love the truckers. They’re on my side.  Speaker 83: ( 01:10:23 ) Thank you.  President Trump: ( 01:10:24 ) I think all of them, frankly. I think pretty much all of them. How about you?  Speaker 84: ( 01:10:27 ) I’m a custodian at the post office as well.  President Trump: ( 01:10:30 ) What do you do exactly?  Speaker 84: ( 01:10:31 ) Clean up everybody’s mess and everybody’s germs. All of that.  President Trump: ( 01:10:34 ) Can I tell you? That profession will never be out of business. You know that, right?  Speaker 84: ( 01:10:39 ) Yeah, for sure.  President Trump: ( 01:10:39 ) Thank you very much for being here.  Speaker 84: ( 01:10:41 ) Thank you for having me.  President Trump: ( 01:10:42 ) How about you?  Speaker 85: ( 01:10:43 ) I’m a registered nurse, President Trump. I work at a New Jersey hospital. It’s called Virtua Willingboro Hospital. I also represent an organization of professional nurses. It’s called the National Association of Catholic Nurses, but I want to tell you, sir, as a nursing supervisor, I am so in awe of your leadership. Honestly, I know many people have said often interesting things, but it takes a cheerleader to be able to ignore all that stuff and do what is right and not be offended by all the words being said. You really do show that positive spirit to us and as nurses, I appreciate that. But just as an individual, I’m grateful for that.  President Trump: ( 01:11:21 ) Well, I’m for the nurses. I’m for the doctors. I’m for everybody. We just have to make this China virus go away and it’s happening. Please, go ahead.  Speaker 86: ( 01:11:29 ) I’m also a nurse. I represent Genesis Healthcare, which is a skilled nursing facility company. I want to thank you and your administration for all the supplies and support and funding that you’ve given the skilled nursing units. Without that, we couldn’t do as well as we have done. I spent some time in New Jersey. I live in West Virginia, went to New Jersey and did some work there. We finally started to see things change and turnaround.  President Trump: ( 01:11:54 ) I appreciate what you said because we have delivered billions of dollars of equipment that governors was supposed to give and in many cases they didn’t get, so the federal government had to help them. All of the people that did this incredible work, they never got credit for it, but you understand where it came from. Thank you very much. Thank you both. It’s really nice. Please, go ahead.  Speaker 87: ( 01:12:16 ) I’m a police officer in Inglewood, Colorado, and I contracted COVID in late March and recovered.  President Trump: ( 01:12:24 ) That means we don’t have to be afraid of you at all, right?  Speaker 87: ( 01:12:26 ) Good to go.  President Trump: ( 01:12:27 ) Once you recovered, we have the whole thing with plasma happening. That means your blood is very valuable.  Speaker 87: ( 01:12:33 ) Yes, it is.  President Trump: ( 01:12:33 ) You know that, right? Thank you very much. Great. Please.  Speaker 88: ( 01:12:37 ) I’m a detention deputy the current county sheriff department in California.  President Trump: ( 01:12:40 ) Great.  Speaker 88: ( 01:12:41 ) I also contracted COVID in March and recovered from that also.  President Trump: ( 01:12:46 ) How long was your problem?  Speaker 88: ( 01:12:48 ) I was sick about 10 days, really bad. I got everything besides the cough, but recovered. I was off work for a month and a half, and I work in our local county jails.  President Trump: ( 01:12:57 ) Did they do anything specifically to help you recover?  Speaker 88: ( 01:13:00 ) They gave me Z-Paks, medication, cough syrup.  President Trump: ( 01:13:03 ) Okay. I won’t even ask you about the hydroxychloroquine because it’s a shame what they’ve done to that one, but I took it. I took the Z-Pak also and zinc. I want to thank you all very much. It’s an honor to have you in the White House. You’re a fantastic people and the people you represent, you represent an incredible group of people and we love you all. Thank you very much. [crosstalk 01:13:27] Thank you very much. Appreciate it.  Congressman Jim Jordan: ( 01:13:30 ) Good evening. I’m Congressman Jim Jordan representing the fourth district of Ohio. The Republican party is the pro-America party. President Trump is the pro-America candidate. This election is about who can preserve the values, principles, and institutions that make America great. Don’t believe me? Look at what’s happening in American cities, cities all run by Democrats, crime violence and mob rule. Democrats refuse to denounce the mob, and their response to the chaos, defund the police, defund border patrol and defund our military. While they’re doing all this, they’re also trying to take away your guns. Look at the positions they’ve taken in the past few months, Democrats, won’t let you go to church, but they let you protest.  Congressman Jim Jordan: ( 01:14:11 ) Democrats won’t let you go to work, but they’ll let you riot and Democrats won’t let you go to school, but they’ll let you go loot. President Trump has fought against each of their crazy ideas. He’s taken on the swamp, all of the swamp, the Democrats, the press, and the never Trumpers. When you take on the swamp, the swamp fights back, they tried the Russia hoax, the Mueller investigation and the fake impeachment, but in spite of this unbelievable opposition, this president has done what he said he would do. Taxes cut, regulations reduced, economy growing, lowest unemployment in 50 years, out of the Iran deal, embassy in Jerusalem, hostages home from North Korea, a new USMCA agreement, and of course he’s building the wall and rebuilding our economy as we speak.  Congressman Jim Jordan: ( 01:14:55 ) I love the president’s intensity and his willingness to fight every day in Washington for our families, but what I also appreciate about the president is something most Americans never get to see, how much he truly cares about people. Our family has seen it. Two years ago, our nephew Eli was killed in a car accident. He lived a mile up the road from us, grew up wrestling and training with our boys, was a high school state champion, varsity athlete for the University of Wisconsin. It was a Saturday morning, three days after the accident, I walked to the car to head up to Eli’s parents’ home when the president called. We talked about a few issues and then he asked how the family was doing. I said, “They’re doing okay, Mr. President, but it’s tough.” The president said, “Yeah, losing a loved one is always difficult. It’s really tough when they’re so young.”  Congressman Jim Jordan: ( 01:15:44 ) I then said, “Mr. President, I’m actually walking into their house right now. Obviously they don’t know that I’m talking to you, but if you’d be willing to say hello to Eli’s dad, you’d make a terrible day a little less terrible.” “What’s his name?” the president asked. I walked through the door and said, “Todd, the president wants to talk to you.” For the next five minutes, family and friends sat in complete silence as the president of the United States took time to talk to a dad who was hurting. That’s the president I’ve gotten to know the last four years. The president who shared private moments like this with soldiers, victims of violent crime and people who’ve had businesses destroyed by the mob. That’s the individual who’s made America great again and who knows America’s best days are still in front of us. That’s why I’m busting my tail to help him get reelected. I’m asking you to do the same. Thank you and God bless our country.  Herschel Walker: ( 01:16:36 ) I’m not an actor, a singer or a politician. I’m Herschel Walker. Most of you know me as a football player, but I’m also a father, a man of faith and a very good judge of character. I’ve known Donald Trump for 37 years and I don’t mean just casual ran into him from time to time. I’m talking about a deep personal friendship. I watched him as an Ann Arbor professional football team. Right after he bought the team, he set out to learn. He learned about the history of the team, the players, the coaches, every detail. Then he used what he learned to make the team better.  Herschel Walker: ( 01:17:15 ) I watched him in the boardroom. He can be in the middle of a big meeting, but if one of the kids was on the phone, he dropped everything to take the call. He taught me that the family should be your top priority. I watched him treat janitors, security guards, and waiters the same way he would treat a VIP. He made them feel special because he knew they were. He understands that they are the people who make this country run. They clean, they cook, they build, they drive, they deliver. He told me, “Herschel, make an effort to get to know people. Remember their names.” That stuck with me.  Herschel Walker: ( 01:17:53 ) One time, I planned to take his kids to Disney world with my family. At the last minute, Donald said he’d like to join us. So there he was in a business suit on a it’s a small world ride. That was something to see. It just shows you what a caring, loving father he is. It hurt my soul to hear the terrible names that people call Donald. The worst one is racist. I take it out as a personal insult that people would think I’ve had a 37 year friendship with a racist. People who think that don’t know what they’re talking about.  Herschel Walker: ( 01:18:27 ) Growing up in the deep South, I’ve seen racism up close. I know what it is and it isn’t Donald Trump. Just because someone loves and respect the flag, our national anthem and our country doesn’t mean they don’t care about social justice. I care about all of those things, so does Donald Trump. He shows how much he cares about social justice in the black community through his actions. His actions speaks louder than stickers or slogans on a jersey. He keeps right on fighting to improve the lives of black Americans and all Americans. He worked night and day. He never stops. He leaves nothing on the field. Some people don’t like his style, the way he knocks down obstacles that get in the way of his goals. People on the opposing team never liked when I ran over them either, but that’s how you get the job done.  Herschel Walker: ( 01:19:17 ) I pray every night that God gives him more time. Give him four more years. He has accomplished so much almost all by himself on a constant attack, but there are still more work to be done. If you love America and want to make it better, Donald Trump is your president. He’s my president and I’m blessed to call him friend.  Natalie Harp: ( 01:19:41 ) Good evening. I’m Natalie Harp, a formerly forgotten American from California. In the classic Jimmy Stewart film, It’s A Wonderful Life, George Bailey is given a great gift, the chance to see what the world would be like without him. Tonight, Mr. President, we’d like to give you that same gift, because without you, we’d all be living in Pottersville, sold out to a crooked mister, or I should say a crooked Mrs. Potter with no hope of escape except death itself. I should know because I wouldn’t be alive today if it wasn’t for you.  Natalie Harp: ( 01:20:17 ) About five years ago, I was a victim of a notoriously deadly medical error. I survived, but only to be diagnosed with a rare and terminal bone cancer. The Democrats love to talk about healthcare being a human right, but a right to what? Well, I’ll tell you. To them, it’s a right to marijuana, opioids and the right to die with dignity. A politically correct way of saying assisted suicide. I was told I was a burden to my family and to my country, and that by choosing to die early, I’d actually be saving the lives of others by preserving resources for them, rather than wasting them on a lost cause like myself.  Natalie Harp: ( 01:20:59 ) When I failed the chemotherapies that were on the market, no one wanted me in their clinical trials. I’d make them look bad. They didn’t give me the right to try experimental treatments, Mr. President. You did and without you, I’d have died waiting for them to be approved. Now with the coronavirus, everyone knows what that feels like to be waiting for a cure, but we’ve only been waiting a few months. Just imagine what 2020 would have looked like fighting for your life without Donald Trump fighting for it too.  Natalie Harp: ( 01:21:28 ) In January, there would have been no China travel ban. Millions would have died. Millions more would have been infected for there be no record levels of testing, no right to try treatments, no fast track for a vaccine, nor operation warp speed ready to deliver it. Without Donald Trump as our patient advocate for the past four years, well, the opioid epidemic would have stolen even more lives from even more families. Kidney patients would have no future except dying on wait lists. For there be known initiative to increase donations, there’d still be no accountability at the VA. Our brave veterans would still be suffering long wait times with no choice nor access to faster care.  Natalie Harp: ( 01:22:10 ) Insulin and other drug prices would have continued to rise while the record number of generic drugs would still be stuck in the pipeline. There’d be no price transparency. We wouldn’t have health plans up to 60% cheaper than Obamacare and we’d still be stuck with that infamous individual mandate. God forbid what the next four years would look like for in Joe Biden’s America, China would control our drug production. We’d be one step closer to government run healthcare. We wouldn’t just be unable to keep our doctors, we’d be lucky if we could see any doctor, and even then, some of us would be denied care for in socialized medicine, you don’t beat the odds, you become the odds. I would lose my right to try just like Charlie Gard, that terminally ill British baby, whose government run healthcare system decided it was too expensive and too cruel to keep him alive.  Natalie Harp: ( 01:23:08 ) You see Mr. President, you’ve done so much more than your promises made and promises kept for numbers only tell part of the story. We are the rest of it. Facts with faces of Americans who would still be forgotten if you and our favorite first lady hadn’t given up your own wonderful life so we could have the chance at one. George Bailey’s father was right. All you can take with you is that what you’ve given away, and Mr. President, that makes you the richest man in the world for you have used your strength to make America strong again, sacrificed the life you built to make America proud again, and you risked everything to make America safe again. It’s a wonderful life. You made America great again, and on November 3rd, we are going to keep America great.  Vernon Jones: ( 01:24:25 ) Hello America. My name is Vernon Jones and I’m a state representative from the great state of Georgia. As you can see, I’m a man of color, and I’m a lifelong Democrat too. You may be wondering, “Why is a lifelong Democrat speaking at the Republican National Convention?” That’s a fair question. Here’s your answer. The Democratic party does not want black people to leave their mental plantation. We’ve been forced to be there for decades and generations, but I have news for Joe Biden. We are free. We are free people with free minds, and I’m part of a large and growing segment of the black community who are independent thinkers, and we believe that Donald Trump is the president that America needs to lead us forward.  Vernon Jones: ( 01:25:18 ) This is no time for sleeping in the basement. Joe Biden has had 47 years to produce results, but he’s been all talk and no action. Just like so many of the Democrats who have been making promises to the black voters for decades, we’ve been their captive audience. When President Trump sought to earn the black vote, the Democratic party leaders went crazy. Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer literally started wearing kente cloths around the US Capitol as if pandering were enough to keep us satisfied.  Vernon Jones: ( 01:25:57 ) Let me tell you why I’m supporting our president. I grew up in the South in Laurel Hill, North Carolina, Scotland County, the green pond community to be exact. My parents, Robert and Rufer Jones built with their own hands a four room cinder block home with no indoor plumbing. They had very limited education, but they instilled in us a strong work ethic that drove me from those tobacco fields of North Carolina to those hallowed halls of the Georgia general assembly. My parents taught me if I believe in God, work hard and treated every person fairly, there was no limit to what we could achieve.  Vernon Jones: ( 01:26:43 ) I attended North Carolina Central University, a historical black college. For generations, HBCUs have been the incubators that developed black scholars and math and science and religion, engineering and politics. They have been important springboards for the black success, but Democrats haven’t treated them that way. When President Trump took office, he changed everything. He delivered historic funding to HBCUs and he guaranteed it for 10 years. Something that has never happened in the history of this country. That gave our HBCUs stability, the chance to grow and produce the next generation of black leaders. That’s right. Donald Trump did that.  Vernon Jones: ( 01:27:32 ) He’s also supported school choice to assure that no child, no matter their race or zip code is left behind. Every child should have access to a quality education, but education is just the beginning. The president also built the most inclusive economy ever with a record low unemployment for African Americans and record high participation in the workforce.  Vernon Jones: ( 01:27:58 ) He put opportunity zones and the Trump tax bill that would drive investment and to our communities for decades to come. He put the interest of American workers and especially black workers first. That’s right. Donald Trump did that. He delivered historic criminal justice reform. He ended once and for all the policy of incarceration of black people, which has decimated our communities caused by no other than Joe Biden. Democrats wouldn’t do it. Obama didn’t want to do it, and Joe Biden and Kamala Harris definitely wouldn’t do it, but Donald Trump did it. He’s also working every day to make our community safer. As a former executive of DeKalb County, Georgia, I directed one of the largest public safety departments in the Southeast.  Vernon Jones: ( 01:28:57 ) I seen tragic shootings on both sides, officers, killing citizens and citizens killing officers in the line of duty. Police officers are a fellow citizens. They live in our country. They have families too. They live in our communities. Unfortunately, Democrats have turned their backs on our brave police officers. They call it defunding, and it’s a danger to our cities, our neighborhoods, and our children. Isn’t it ironic that Democrat politicians have personal security to protect them? So, why don’t they forego their security and replaced them with social workers, especially since that’s what they want for you and me. Our police need more funding, not less for frequent psychological examinations, for non-lethal remote restraint technology and for more deescalation and use of force training. These are the common sense solutions that President Trump supports true, sincere police reform. That’s right, Donald Trump did that too.  Vernon Jones: ( 01:30:11 ) Education, jobs, safety, security, on issue after issue and in just a single term, he destroyed these negative forces that have victimized the black community for decades. He gave us the opportunity to rise. Now, when I made the public announcement of my support for President Trump, all hell broke loose. I was threatened, called an embarrassment and asked to resign by my own party. Unfortunately, that’s consistent with the Democratic party and how they view independent thinking black men and women. But, I’m here to tell you that black voices are becoming more woke and louder than ever.  Vernon Jones: ( 01:31:11 ) The democratic party has become infected with a pandemic of intolerance, bigotry, socialism, anti law enforcement bias, and a dangerous tolerance for people who attack others, destroy their property and terrorize our own communities. That’s what this election is all about. That’s why right now, more than ever, more than ever before, America needs Donald Trump in the oval office for another four years. God bless you and vote Donald J. Trump. Thank you.  Andrew Pollack: ( 01:32:04 ) In 2018, a gunman walked into Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, and changed my life forever. My name is Andrew Pollack, his name isn’t worth saying. One of the seniors walking in the hallways that day was my beautiful daughter, Meadow. She was just months away from graduating and beginning a new life. We were so proud of the woman she had become, but in the hallway on that third floor, the gunman saw Meadow and shot her down the hallway, hitting her four times.  Andrew Pollack: ( 01:32:41 ) After she was shot and on the floor, she crawled over to another student, a freshman girl to protect her. She draped her body over her and then the scumbag gunman shot my daughter at point blank range five more times killing Meadow and the girl she was shielding. She had a whole life ahead of her and in that life, she could have done anything and been anything. So many moments that I waited so long for were taken from me. I didn’t get to drop her off at college. I didn’t get to walk her down the aisle, but every moment was taken from her, and for what?  Andrew Pollack: ( 01:33:24 ) I never wanted this to become a political spectacle, but it did. I never wanted to meet the president like this, but I did. I was invited to the White House. The truth is I had just buried my daughter that week. I really wasn’t interested in public events like a tour or a photo op. I was interested in answers and solutions. So, if the president wanted to meet me personally, I said I’d go. They said of course that was his plan.  Andrew Pollack: ( 01:33:51 ) At the White House, my family and I sat with the president in the oval office and told him about Meadow. I told them what we knew. I told them that his administration needed to take a closer look at what went wrong and why. I got to see who President Trump really is. He’s a good man and a great listener and he cuts through the BS. Then the president did what he said he would do. He took action. He formed a school safety commission that issued dozens of recommendations to make school safer, but I’ll bet you never heard about that. Instead, the media turned my daughter’s murder into a coordinated attack on President Trump, Republicans and our second amendment.  Andrew Pollack: ( 01:34:36 ) In fact, when President Trump asked me and other parents of children that were murdered in school shootings to join him as he announced the commission’s findings, the media’s first question wasn’t about protecting kids. Shockingly, they asked about the government shutdown. President Trump turned to me appalled and said, “Andy, can you believe these people? We’re trying to talk about school safety and this is what they do.” But, I could believe it.  Andrew Pollack: ( 01:35:06 ) After my daughter’s murder, the media didn’t seem interested in the facts. So, I found them myself. I learned that gun control laws didn’t fail my daughter, people did. The gunman had threatened to kill his classmates before. He had threatened to rape them. He had threatened to shoot up the school. Every red flag you could imagine, but the school didn’t just miss these red flags, they knowingly ignored them. Far left Democrats in our school district made this shooting possible because they implemented something they called restorative justice. This policy, which really just blames teachers for student’s failures puts kids and teachers at risk and make shootings more likely, but it was built as a pioneering approach to discipline and safety. I was just fine with the old approach to discipline and safety. It was called discipline and safety, but the Obama-Biden administration took Parkland’s bad policies and forced them into schools across America.  Andrew Pollack: ( 01:36:12 ) When President Trump rescinded Obama’s guidance on restorative justice policies, he put an end to that and that meant the world to me. It’s hard to tell how much Mr. Biden understands about what happened at Parkland. Mr. Biden has campaigned on bringing back restorative justice as part of his unity platform with Bernie Sanders and has pledged to implement in school districts across America, but he doesn’t even seem to know when the shooting happened. He said that he vice president when it happened, but he wasn’t.  Andrew Pollack: ( 01:36:46 ) Mr. Biden may not know when my daughter was murdered, but I do, February 14th, 2018. Mr. Biden may not know that these policies make shootings more likely, but I do. Mr. Biden may not know who was vice president that day, but I do it. It wasn’t Joe Biden. It was Mike Pence. Thank God. I know who the president was too. It wasn’t Barack Obama, it was President Donald J. Trump and he took action. I truly believe the safety of our kids depends on whether this man is reelected. I hope you’ll join me in helping to make that happen.  Andrew Pollack: ( 01:37:27 ) Mr. President, myself and millions of Americans appreciate you and love you. God bless America and God bless our president, Donald J. Trump. Thank you.  Speaker 89: ( 01:37:42 ) A curfew now in effect for the city of St. Louis.  Speaker 90: ( 01:37:44 ) Protests in St. Louis turn violent.  Speaker 91: ( 01:37:46 ) You a racist. You a coward …  Speaker 92: ( 01:37:49 ) Call the … cops. You …  Speaker 93: ( 01:37:49 ) We going to kill …  Speaker 94: ( 01:37:49 ) I’m a rape you …  Speaker 95: ( 01:37:58 ) Mark McCloskey says he and his family have been threatened with violence.  Speaker 96: ( 01:38:02 ) Under Missouri law, you have a right to defend your home and the lives of your family.  Speaker 97: ( 01:38:05 ) A search warrant has been executed at the home of Mark and Patricia McCloskey.  Speaker 98: ( 01:38:10 ) The husband and wife attorneys charged with pointing guns at protesters.  Speaker 95: ( 01:38:13 ) They were simply tried to protect their home.  Mark McCloskey: ( 01:38:16 ) Good evening America. We are Mark and Patty McCloskey. We’re speaking to you tonight from St. Louis, Missouri, where just weeks ago you may have seen us defending our home as a mob of protesters descended on our neighborhood.  Patricia McCloskey: ( 01:38:29 ) America is such a great country that not only do you have the right to own a gun and use it to defend yourself, but thousands of Americans will offer you free advice on how to use it, at least that’s what we experienced. What you saw happened to us could just as easily happen to any of you who are watching from quiet neighborhoods around our country. That’s what we want to speak to you about tonight.  Mark McCloskey: ( 01:38:54 ) That’s exactly right. Whether it’s the defunding of police, ending cash bails or criminals can be released back out on the streets the same day to riot again, or encouraging anarchy and chaos on our streets, it seems as if the Democrats no longer view the government’s job as protecting honest citizens from criminals, but rather protecting criminals from honest citizens. Not a single person in the out of control mob you saw at our house was charged with a crime, but you know who was? We were. They’ve actually charged us with felonies for daring to defend our home.  Mark McCloskey: ( 01:39:36 ) On top of that, consider this. The Marxist liberal activist leading the mob to our neighborhood stood outside our home with a bull horn screaming, “You can’t stop the revolution.” Just weeks later, that same Marxist activist won the Democrat nomination to hold a seat in the US house of representatives in the city of St. Louis. That’s the same as winning the general election. That Marxist revolutionary is now going to be the congresswoman from the first district of Missouri. These radicals are not content with marching in the streets. They want to walk the halls of Congress. They want to take over. They want power. This is Joe Biden’s party. These are the people who will be in charge of your future and the future of your children.  Patricia McCloskey: ( 01:40:27 ) They’re not satisfied with spreading the chaos and violence into our communities. They want to abolish the suburbs altogether by ending single family home zoning. This forestry zoning would bring crime, lawlessness and low quality apartments into now thriving suburban neighborhoods. President Trump smartly ended this government overreach, but Joe Biden wants to bring it back. These are the policies that are coming to a neighborhood near you. So make no mistake, no matter where you live, your family will not be safe in the radical Democrats America.  Mark McCloskey: ( 01:41:03 ) At this moment in history, if you stand up for yourself and for the values our country was founded on, the mob spurred on by their allies and the media will try to destroy you. You’ve seen us on your TV screens and Twitter feeds. You know that we’re not the kind of people who backed down. Thankfully, neither is Donald Trump. President Trump will defend the God given right of every American to protect their homes and their families. But more than that, Trump’s vision for America is a country where you have an opportunity to work hard and build the life you dream of with a job you love, with your children being educated in great schools in a community where your family can play in the backyard without fear, worship in a church without shame and express your beliefs without retribution. Trump brought us the greatest economy our country had ever seen. The Democrats have brought us nothing but destruction.  Patricia McCloskey: ( 01:42:06 ) When we don’t have basic safety and security in our communities, we’ll never be free to build a brighter future for ourselves, for our children or for our country. That’s what’s at stake in this election and that’s why we must re-elect Donald Trump. God bless you. God bless the president and God bless the United States.  Mark McCloskey: ( 01:42:28 ) And God bless the United States.  Kimberly Guilfoyle: ( 01:42:36 ) Good evening, America. I’m Kimberly Guilfoyle. I speak to you tonight as a mother, a former prosecutor, a Latina, and a proud American and yes, a proud supporter of President Donald J. Trump. Why? Because he is the president who delivers for America. He built the greatest economy the world has ever known for the strivers, the working class and middle class. As commander in chief, he always puts America first. President Trump is the law and order president. Now, presidential leadership is not guaranteed. It is a choice. Biden, Harris and the rest of the socialists will fundamentally change this nation. They want open borders, closed schools, dangerous amnesty, and will selfishly send your jobs back to China while they get rich. They will defund, dismantle and destroy America’s law enforcement. When you are in trouble and need police, don’t count on the Democrats.  Kimberly Guilfoyle: ( 01:43:46 ) As a first generation American, I know how dangerous their socialist agenda is. My mother, Mercedes, was a special education teacher from Aguadilla, Puerto Rico. My father, also an immigrant, came to this nation in pursuit of the American dream. Now, I consider it my duty to fight to protect that dream. Rioters must not be allowed to destroy our cities. Human sex drug traffickers should not be allowed to cross our border. The same socialist policies, which destroyed places like Cuba and Venezuela must not take root in our cities and our schools. If you want to see the socialized Biden-Harris future for our country, just take a look at California. It is a place of immense wealth, immeasurable innovation and immaculate environment and the Democrats turned it into a land of discarded heroin needles in parks, riots in streets and blackouts in homes. In President Trump’s America, we light things up. We don’t dim them down. We build things up. We don’t burn-  Kimberly Guilfoyle: ( 01:45:03 ) … down. We build things up. We don’t burn them down. We kneel in prayer and we stand for our flag. This election is a battle for the soul of America. Your choice is clear. Do you support the cancel culture? The cosmopolitan elites of Nancy Pelosi, Chuck Schumer, and Joe Biden, who blame America first? Do you think America is to blame or do you believe in American greatness? Believe in yourself, in President Trump and individual and personal responsibility? They want to destroy this country and everything that we have fought for and hold dear. They want to steal your liberty, your freedom. They want to control what you see and think and believe so that they can control how you live. They want to enslave you to the weak, dependent, liberal victim ideology to the point that you will not recognize this country or yourself.  Kimberly Guilfoyle: ( 01:46:16 ) From the beginning, when President Trump spoke about making America great again, he was speaking about that shining city on a hill and restoring the beacon of light that once shined so bright. His promise was to put America first and he has. When President Trump cut middle-class taxes, putting tens of thousands of dollars back in the pockets of working class Americans, that beacon began to flicker once again. When President Trump commanded the defeat of ISIS, took out al-Baghdadi and Soleimani and paved the way for peace in the Middle East, that beacon started to glow. When he negotiated historic trade deals with Canada, Mexico, Japan, and China, bringing back thousands of manufacturing jobs to America, that beacon shined bright once again for the world to see. America, it’s all on the line. President Trump believes in you, he emancipates and lifts you up to live your American dream.  Kimberly Guilfoyle: ( 01:47:28 ) You are capable, you are qualified, you are powerful, and you have the ability to choose your life and determine your destiny. Don’t let the Democrats take you for granted. Don’t let them step on you. Don’t let them destroy your families, your lives and your future. Don’t let them kill future generations because they told you and brainwash you and fed you lies that you weren’t good enough. Like my parents, you can achieve your American dream. You can be that shiny example to the world. Manifest and be the change in this country that you dream, that you hope, that you believe in. Stand for an American president who is fearless, who believes in you and who loves this country and will fight for her. President Trump is the leader who will rebuild the promise of America and ensure that every citizen can realize their American dream.  Kimberly Guilfoyle: ( 01:48:31 ) Ladies and gentlemen, leaders and fighters for our freedom and liberty and the American dream, the best is yet to come.  Matt Gaetz: ( 01:49:05 ) I’m Congressman Steve Scalise. We’re facing some tough challenges in America. This isn’t the first time we’ve been here. I’ve worked closely with Donald Trump over the last few years and if there’s one constant theme to how he approaches problems, it’s how much he cares about the hardworking people that Washington left behind. I’ve seen this firsthand. After I was shot on a baseball field by a leftist gunman, first responders rushed me to a hospital where I battled for my life. That same night, Donald Trump came to the hospital along with first lady, Melania Trump. They consoled my wife Jennifer. They were there for my family in my darkest hours. Donald Trump would call to check on me throughout the following weeks just to see how I was doing. That’s the kind of person he is. That’s the side of Donald Trump that the media will never show you.  Matt Gaetz: ( 01:49:57 ) Look, there’s a lot at stake. This is an election between a party that wants to burn down the foundations of our country to the ground and a party that wants to rebuild and protect our great nation. The left wants to defund the police. This is personal to me. I wouldn’t be here without the bravery and heroism of the men and women in law enforcement who saved my life. President Trump stands with those brave men and women. Joe Biden has embraced the left’s insane mission to defund them. There won’t be an America to leave to our children and grandchildren without those brave law enforcement officers and first responders. Joe Biden’s made a career in Washington for 47 years, promising things he’s never delivered. In just three short years, President Trump has delivered huge wins for American families. While Joe Biden made hollow promises when he chaired the Senate judiciary committee, Donald Trump took action and delivered criminal justice reform.  Matt Gaetz: ( 01:50:54 ) Joe Biden claims to care about the working man, but millions of good manufacturing jobs were shipped overseas during the Obama Biden years to countries like China. Donald Trump brought those jobs back. I’ve seen how deeply President Trump cares about rebuilding our evaporating middle class. President Trump pledged to give the forgotten men and women of America a real shot at the American dream, and again, he delivered. The lowest unemployment rate in over 50 years, women creating small businesses at record pace, wages rising, the fastest, by the way, for lowest income levels. What can Joe Biden say to that? What has Joe Biden done in his 47 years in Washington that can compare to that?  Matt Gaetz: ( 01:51:37 ) President Trump has delivered for the hardworking people of this great nation. It’s going to take that kind of bold leadership to get us out of this COVID crisis. After President Trump’s saved lives by shutting down flights from China and Europe, he’s now focusing the full weight of the government on a revolutionary plan to cure this virus by cutting red tape and empowering scientists to create a vaccine. This is visionary leadership and action at a time when we can’t afford another 47 years of hollow promises. America’s been through tough times before. Who better to lead us out of these times than the president who already built the strongest economy our country has ever seen. Donald Trump did it before, Donald Trump will deliver for us again. God bless you and God bless these United States of America.  Sean Parnell: ( 01:52:42 ) I’m Sean Parnell, and it is an honor to be here. In 2006, the army sent me to Afghanistan as a young platoon leader placed in command of Americans from every corner of our planet. Our platoon reflected the diversity of our nation, every race, creed, and religion. Despite those differences, we were bound together as brothers from the same American family. On June 10th, 2006, our platoon was attacked just after dawn. Outnumbered, 10 to one, we endured mortar and machine gunfire as hundreds of Taliban charged us from three sides. We had 24 men that day. Wave after wave of Taliban advanced up the hill. I was wounded three times in the fighting. Nearly all of my platoon was wounded within the first minute, but the enemy kept coming. We fought to our last rounds of ammunition and when it was over, we held the hill.  Sean Parnell: ( 01:53:39 ) In the face of death, I saw ordinary Americans become heroes. In our darkest hour, when our survival depended on each other, my men and I learned an important lesson. We all bleed red. Our differences did not define us. United, we were unbeatable. After 485 days of combat, I came home eager to enjoy the freedoms I risked my life to defend. But I watched with alarm as the party of my grandfather, a life long union Democrat, turned against the very people it professed to represent. I watched as Joe Biden spit venom at an auto worker who dared to question Joe’s intent to dismantle the second amendment and take your guns. Where Democrats one stood for hardworking law, abiding Americans who displayed our flag with pride, this new Democrat party considers these people uneducated racists clinging to guns and bibles. The party of Harry Truman became the party of hedge fund managers, Hollywood celebrities, tech, moguls, and university professors, all bloated with contempt for middle America.  Sean Parnell: ( 01:54:48 ) I look across the aisle and I do not see a party that wants you to pursue your dreams. I see a Democrat party that wants to dictate what those dreams are. I don’t see a party that wants you to be free. I see a party that wants to chain you to conformity and will destroy anyone they deem a heretic. I swore an oath to defend my country and its constitution. President Trump has sworn to do the same. That’s why he’s advanced freedom, despite savage political attacks to overcome the agenda of the radical left. President Trump has unleashed the economic might of this nation like no other president in our history. He triggered the rising tide of working families, brought us energy independence, reclaimed jobs from overseas that Democrats said would never return. He has fiercely defended the besieged first and second amendment. That is just to start.  Sean Parnell: ( 01:55:45 ) With four more years, imagine what we can achieve by simply working with our president. I believe in our president’s vision for the future. I stand here tonight, calling on all Americans to join us. It doesn’t matter what you look like, who you love, how you worship your gender or your job. If you’re a traditional Democrat who’s become disillusioned with how radical your party has become, then stand with us. You are most welcome. America needs all her patriots to rush to her defense. My fellow Americans, I promise you this, in our tent, you are free. Free to speak the truth. Choose your journey, define your life. You have the power to go as far as you aim, then aim higher and keep going because that is what Americans do. We are idealists and dreamers, lovers of adventure. We’re rugged and independent. We don’t make excuses. We make the impossible a reality.  Sean Parnell: ( 01:56:45 ) Think about it. In a century, we went from ground bound dreamers gazing to the stars, to doers who created the means to reach them. This is not the time to stand on the sidelines. If you love our country as we do, as our president does, join the chorus of patriot voices that will preserve this exceptional union. Mr. President, lead the way. Millions in our American family believe in this path to destiny. Guide us to that horizon. Thank you, and may God bless the United States of America.  Speaker 1: ( 01:57:27 ) We come together to imagine a future determined by the shining light of our hopes and values and faith. A country where we are judged by our character with dignity and respect for all. The belief that all are created equal, that lives matter irrespective of race, creed, or color. Committed to excelling beyond our dreams. Four years ago, we faced an historic crossroad career. Politicians promising change every election, but delivering emptiness. We chose a different path. A man who is not a politician, a man who cares, a man who works tirelessly for you.  Speaker 1: ( 01:58:24 ) Still politicians spun their deceptions and obstructed progress, fanning the flames of lawlessness. We all know that it is easy to criticize. It takes a true leader to solve problems. COVID-19, while others criticized without solutions, president Trump’s with action saved lives and as leading Democrats want to keep businesses closed down, our president is leading the way for a full economic recovery. We are America. We as Americans work together to overcome challenges, write our own stories.  Speaker 1: ( 01:59:04 ) America, land of promise, land of opportunity, land of heroes, land of greatness.  Donald Trump: ( 01:59:20 ) I thought I had been forgotten.  Donald Trump: ( 01:59:24 ) I nearly gave up hope.  Donald Trump: ( 01:59:28 ) I was so afraid. I believed I would die here.  Donald Trump: ( 01:59:35 ) American hostages, forgotten and wasting away in far off prisons, wrongfully detained by foreign governments. Americans were beaten, abused, starved, and left for dead until President Donald Trump stepped in.  Donald Trump: ( 01:59:54 ) The three American hostages are finally back on U.S soil after being held captive in North Korea.  Donald Trump: ( 01:59:59 ) We’re following some breaking news in Turkey where an American pastor, Andrew Brunson, has been released.  Donald Trump: ( 02:00:04 ) An American jailed in Egypt is back in the U.S. this morning after an intervention by the Trump administration.  Donald Trump: ( 02:00:10 ) A tough and skilled negotiator, President Trump successfully won the release of detainees and prisoners among the most of any president in American history. While families waited in despair for news of their loved ones, President Trump provided a new spark of hope by bringing our hostages home.  Donald Trump: ( 02:00:29 ) We have Danny Burch back home where he should be. He was in Yemen in a very horrible situation. Yesterday, the United States government secured the release of Caitlan Coleman, Joshua Boyle, and their three children. Today, we are bringing home another American citizen. Just had news that Turkey released a prisoner that we were trying to get to the United States.  Donald Trump: ( 02:00:57 ) Under this administration, America has not and will not turn its back on our people. President Trump will bring them home.  Speaker 1: ( 02:01:15 ) Diplomacy, negotiation skills, perseverance, faith. The ingredients of hope when there is no hope. No American should ever be left behind. Priority, freeing American hostages.  President Trump: ( 02:01:36 ) We have six incredible people who were held hostage by various countries, and I’m very pleased to let everybody know that we brought back over 50 hostages from 22 different countries. We work very hard on it, Ambassador O’Brien and others. I will tell you, we’re very proud of the job we did, but I’d like to ask maybe Pastor Brunson to say a few words or we can go through and just give us a little history of what happened and how is life treating you?  Andrew Brunson: ( 02:02:05 ) I was held in Turkey for two years and you took unprecedented steps, actually, to secure my release and your administration really fought for me. I think if you hadn’t done that, I may still be in Turkey. I’m very grateful for that.  President Trump: ( 02:02:20 ) Could have been there for 28 years, right? They had you scheduled for a long time, Andrew. We had to get you back. I have to say that to me, President Erdogan was very good. I know that had you scheduled for a long time and you were a very innocent person and ultimately, after we had a few conversations, he agreed. So we appreciate that and we appreciate the people of Turkey and you still appreciate the people of Turkey. I understand. Right?  Andrew Brunson: ( 02:02:46 ) I love the Turkish people. [inaudible 00:17:47].  President Trump: ( 02:02:48 ) It’s great to have you back, Andrew. Thank you. Please.  Sam Goodwin: ( 02:02:51 ) Mr. President, thank you for having me. My name is Sam Goodwin. I’m from St. Louis, Missouri. I was held in Syria for 63 days and I think I speak for my fellow former hostages and detainees here when I say I’m as grateful as I’ve ever been for anything to be home safely, and thank you for the invitation and opportunity to be here. Particularly Ambassador O’Brien was incredibly supportive and helpful to my family and I can’t say enough nice things about him. Thank you for promoting him and just really happy to be here. So thank you.  President Trump: ( 02:03:22 ) We got you back.  Sam Goodwin: ( 02:03:23 ) You got me back, yeah.  President Trump: ( 02:03:24 ) We got you all back and we have some more that we’re working on right now to get back that we better do. Please, go ahead.  Michael White: ( 02:03:30 ) My name is Michael White, Mr. President. Once again, it’s an honor to be here, honor to meet you in person. Basically what had happened with me is I traveled over to the country of Iran. Turned out it was a major, major trap, and I was apprehended there. I went through a lot in their injustice system, the Iranian justice system. Iran is an oppressive, extortionist, terrorist regime. You know what I’m talking about. But what you did, sir, is you were able to get me out of that prison record time. It was amazing.  President Trump: ( 02:04:00 ) Thank you very much.  Michael White: ( 02:04:00 ) Thank you, Mr. President. The honor is all mine.  President Trump: ( 02:04:02 ) Please.  Josh Holt: ( 02:04:04 ) Yeah. My name is Josh Holt. This is my wife Tammy. We were held hostage in Venezuela for two years.  President Trump: ( 02:04:08 ) I know very well.  Josh Holt: ( 02:04:11 ) You helped us get out. Senator Hatch worked with you very well on that as well. It was a great honor to be able to meet you right when we got back. I remember a lot of people asked me, “What was it like meeting President Trump?” I just say, “I was blown away.” I had just gotten released after two years, then I’m shaking the hand of the president in the Oval Office. I don’t really remember a whole lot of it. So it’s nice to meet you again, and it’s been great. It’s been great to be back helping people through situations that they’ve gone through. Now we have started our family.  President Trump: ( 02:04:37 ) Well, the great people of Utah really wanted me to do something about the two of you. We were able to do it and a little bit of a miracle, I think, frankly.  Josh Holt: ( 02:04:47 ) It was.  President Trump: ( 02:04:47 ) Because that was a very hostile period, and we appreciate everybody working so hard with us, but we were able to get you both back. Are you living in Utah now, I hope?  Josh Holt: ( 02:04:56 ) We’re still in Utah.  President Trump: ( 02:04:56 ) That’s good. Well, say hello to the folks in Utah because they are great people. Thank you very much. Congratulations.  Josh Holt: ( 02:05:02 ) Thank you.  President Trump: ( 02:05:03 ) Please.  Brad: ( 02:05:05 ) Brad [inaudible 02:05:05], spent a unexpected trip there in India. I was not going to India. I was going through India to Nepal, where I’d been working for the last 18 years. But on behalf of my family and myself, thank you, President Trump for getting us out and getting us home. The darkest moment of our whole time together, your letter to my wife came and it really gave her the hope and the peace and from that time forward, as more people got involved, especially the ambassador there in India, things became more peaceful and the hope was there for the last four months that we really would get to come home because they had planned on keeping me for three to five years. The original charge thing was three to five years and that was cleared, and then they came up with new charges to do a seven year term.  President Trump: ( 02:05:51 ) Well, India responded very well to my request. So we appreciate that.  Brad: ( 02:05:56 ) And appreciate everything y’all did.  President Trump: ( 02:05:58 ) Thank you all for being with us. We have a few more people we want to get back and we will get them back and they’ll be back very soon. Thank you very much. Appreciate it. Great stories.  Maximo Alvarez: ( 02:06:12 ) Hello, my name is Maximo Alvarez. I live in Miami, Florida, not far from the state of Florida, which isn’t just a 90 mile wide blue strip on a map for me. It divides freedom from fear, it divides the past from the future. I know all about the past. I’ll never forget my own. My family has fled totalitarianism and communism more than once. First, my dad from Spain and then from Cuba, but my family’s don’t run away. By the grace of God, I live the American dream, the greatest blessing I ever had. My dad only had a sixth grade education told me, “Don’t lose this place. You will never be as lucky as me.”  Maximo Alvarez: ( 02:07:14 ) I’m speaking to you today because my family’s done abandoning what we rightfully earned. There’s no place to hide. I’m speaking to you today because President Trump may not always be politically correct. He is, in fact, a successful businessman, not your average career politician. Our president is just another family man, a friend, and most important, our elected commander in chief who puts America first. Keep in mind, the other guy running for president is mostly concerned about power. Yes, yes. Power for them, but not for the benefit of all Americans.  Maximo Alvarez: ( 02:08:02 ) I’m speaking to you today because I have seen people like this before. I’ve seen movements like this before. I’ve seen a BS like this before, and I am here to tell you, we cannot let them take over our country. I heard the promises of Fidel Castro and I can never forget all those who grew up around me who look like me, who suffer and starved and died because they believed those empty promises. They swallow the communist poison pill. If you have a chance, go the Freedom Tower in Miami, stop and listen. You can still hear the sounds of those broken promises. It is the sound of waves in the ocean carrying families clinging to pieces of wood, families with children who can’t swim, but willing to risk everything to reach this blessed land. It is the sound of tears hitting the paper of an application to become an American citizen.  Maximo Alvarez: ( 02:09:18 ) Most heard and liked the promises, but soon after they experienced the reality. Look at them, listen to them, learn the truth. Those false promises spread the wealth. Free education, free healthcare, defund the police, trust a socially state more than your family and your community. They don’t sound radical to my ears. They sound familiar. When Fidel Castro was asked if he was a communist, he said he was a Roman Catholic. He knew he had to hide the truth. But the country I was born in is gone, totally destroyed. When I watch the news in Seattle, Chicago, Portland, and other cities, when I see the history being rewritten, when I hear the promises, I hear echos of a former life I never wanted to hear again. I see shadows I thought I had outrun.  Maximo Alvarez: ( 02:10:42 ) My parents only wanted one person to decide my fate. Me. Not some party member, not some government official, not some bureaucrat. In America, I would decide my own future. I am so grateful to America, the place where I was able to build my American dream through hard work and determination. President Trump knows that the American story was written by people just like you and I who love our country and take risks to build a future for our families and neighbors. I may be a Cuba born, but I am 100% American. This is the greatest country in the world.  Maximo Alvarez: ( 02:11:38 ) I said this before, if I gave away everything that I have today, it would not equal 1% of what I was given when I came to this great country of ours. The gift of freedom. Right now, it is up to us to decide our fate and to choose freedom over oppression. President Trump, he’s fighting the forces of anarchy and communism, and I know he will continue to do just that. What about his opponent and the rest of the DC swamp? I have no doubt that we’ll hand the country over to those dangerous forces. You and I will decide, and here’s what I’ve decided. My decision is very easy. I choose President Trump because I choose America. I choose freedom. I still hear my dad. There is no other place to go. Thank you, and may the good Lord bless America.  News clips: ( 02:13:07 ) The Democrats are just going more and more left.  News clips: ( 02:13:14 ) Many positive about socialism, liking it more than capitalism.  News clips: ( 02:13:18 ) Many of the ideas we fought for that were considered radical are now. Mainstream.  News clips: ( 02:13:24 ) The compromise that they came up with, if implemented, will make Biden the most progressive president since FDR.  Speaker 99: ( 02:13:34 ) The radical left has taken over the democratic party, and Joe Biden is marching in lock step with them. Biden and the far left are promising to crush middle class families with trillions in new taxes.  Joe Biden: ( 02:13:48 ) If you elect me, your taxes are going to be raised, not cut.  Speaker 99: ( 02:13:50 ) Promising amnesty and healthcare for 11 million illegal immigrants.  Joe Biden: ( 02:13:55 ) Citizenship for 11 million undocumented folks.  Speaker 99: ( 02:13:57 ) Promising to shut down energy exploration, killing jobs and hurting America’s economy.  Joe Biden: ( 02:14:04 ) I guarantee you, we’re going to add fossil fuel.  Speaker 99: ( 02:14:06 ) In Joe Biden’s America, the radical left get whatever they want and you get to pay for it. They’ve already taken over Joe Biden and the democratic party. Don’t let them take over America.  Nikki Haley: ( 02:14:28 ) Good evening. I’m Nikki Haley, and it’s great to be back at the Republican National Convention. I’ll start with a little story. It’s about an American ambassador to the United Nations and it’s a speech she gave to this convention. She called for the reelection of the Republican president she served and she called out his democratic opponent, a former vice president from a failed administration. That ambassador said, and I quote, ” Democrats always blame America first.” The year was 1984. The president was Ronald Reagan and ambassador Jean Kirkpatrick’s words are just as true today. Joe Biden and the Democrats are still blaming America first. Donald Trump has always put America first and he has earned four more years as president. It was an honor of a lifetime to serve as the United States ambassador to the United Nations. Now the UN is not for the faint of heart. It’s a place where dictators, murderers and thieves denounce America, and then put their hands out and demand that we pay their bills. Well, President Trump put an end to all of that. With his leadership, we did what Barack Obama and Joe Biden refused to do. We stood up for America and we stood against our enemies. Obama and Biden let North Korea threaten America. President Trump rejected that weakness and we passed the toughest sanctions on North Korea in history. Obama and Biden let Iran get away with murder and literally sent them a plane full of cash. President Trump did the right thing and ripped up the Iran nuclear deal.  Nikki Haley: ( 02:16:29 ) Obama and Biden led the United nations to denounce our friend and ally Israel. President Trump moved our embassy to Jerusalem, and when the UN tried to condemn us, I was proud to cast the American veto. This president has a record of strength and success. The former vice president has a record of weakness and failure. Joe Biden is good for Iran and ISIS, great for communist China, and he’s a godsend to everyone who wants America to apologize, abstain and abandon our values. Donald Trump takes a different approach. He’s tough on China and he took on ISIS and won, and he tells the world what it needs to hear.  Nikki Haley: ( 02:17:20 ) At home, the president is the clear choice on jobs in the economy. He’s moved America forward while Joe Biden has held America back. When Joe was VP, I was governor of the great state of South Carolina. We had a pretty good run. Manufacturers of all kinds flocked to our state from overseas, creating tens of thousands of American jobs. People were referring to South Carolina as the beast of the Southeast, which I loved. Everything we did happened in spite of Joe Biden and his old boss. We cut taxes, they raised them. We slashed red tape, they piled on more mandates. When we brought in good paying jobs, Biden and Obama sued us. I fought back and they gave up.  Nikki Haley: ( 02:18:15 ) A Biden/Harris administration would be much, much worse. Last time, Joe’s boss was Obama. This time it would be Pelosi, Sanders, and the squad. Their vision for America is socialism and we know that socialism has failed everywhere. They want to tell Americans how to live, what to think. They want a government takeover of healthcare. They want to ban fracking and kill millions of jobs. They want massive tax hikes on working families. Joe Biden, and the socialist left would be a disaster for our economy, but President Trump is leading a new era of opportunity. Before communist China gave us the coronavirus, we were breaking economic records left and right. The pandemic has set us back, but not for long. President Trump brought our economy back before and he will bring it back again.  Nikki Haley: ( 02:19:19 ) There’s one more important area where our president is right. He knows that political correctness and cancel culture are dangerous and just plain wrong. In much of the democratic party, it’s now fashionable to say that America is racist. That is a lie. America is not a racist country. This is personal for me. I am the proud daughter of Indian immigrants. They came to America and settled in a small Southern town. My father wore a turban. My mother wore a sari. I was a brown girl in a black and white world. We face-  Nikki Haley: ( 02:20:03 ) … brown girl in a black and white world, we face discrimination and hardship, but my parents never gave in to grievance and hate. My mom built a successful business, my dad taught 30 years at a historically black college and the people of South Carolina chose me as their first minority and first female governor. America is a story that’s a work in progress. Now is the time to build on that progress and make America even freer, fairer and better for everyone. That’s why it’s so tragic to see so much of the democratic party turning a blind eye towards riots and rage. The American people know we can do better. And of course we value and respect every black life. The black cops who’ve been shot in the line of duty, they matter. The black small business owners who’ve watched their life’s work go up and flames, they matter. The black kids who’ve been gunned down on the playground, their lives matter too and their lives are being ruined and stolen by the violence on our streets.  Nikki Haley: ( 02:21:12 ) It doesn’t have to be like this. It wasn’t like this in South Carolina, five years ago. Our state came face to face with evil. A white supremacist walked into Mother Emmanuel church during Bible study, 12 African Americans pulled up a chair and prayed with him for an hour. Then he began to shoot. After that horrific tragedy, we didn’t turn against each other. We came together, black and white, Democrat and Republican, together we made the hard choices needed to heal and removed a divisive symbol peacefully and respectfully. What happened then should give us hope now. America isn’t perfect, but the principles we hold dear are perfect. If there’s one thing I’ve learned, it’s that even on our worst day, we are blessed to live in America. It’s time to keep that blessing alive for the next generation. This president and this party are committed to that noble task.  Nikki Haley: ( 02:22:26 ) We seek a nation that rises together, not falls apart in anarchy and anger. We know that the only way to overcome America’s challenges, is to embrace America’s strengths. We are striving to reach a brighter future, where every child goes to a world class school chosen by their parents, where every family lives in a safe community with good jobs, where every entrepreneur has the freedom to achieve and inspire, where every believer can worship without fear and every life is protected. Where every girl and boy, every woman and man of every race and religion has the best shot at the best life. In this election, we must choose the only candidate who has and who will continue delivering on that vision. President Trump and vice president Pence have my support and America has our promise. We will build on the progress of our past and unlock the promise of our future. That future starts when the American people reelect president Donald Trump. Thank you, goodnight and may God always bless America.  Donald Trump Jr.: ( 02:24:04 ) Good evening America. I’m Donald Trump Jr. We’re here tonight to talk about the great American story, to talk about this country we all love, this land of promise and opportunity, of heroes and greatness. Just a few short months ago, we were seeing the American dream become a reality for more of our citizens than ever before. The greatest prolonged economic expansion in American history, the lowest unemployment rate in nearly 50 years, the lowest unemployment rates ever for black Americans, Hispanic Americans, women, and pretty much every other demographic group. And then, courtesy of the Chinese Communist Party, the virus struck. The president quickly took action and shut down travel from China. Joe Biden and his Democrat allies, called my father a racist and a xenophobe for doing it. They put political correctness ahead of the safety and security of the American people.  Donald Trump Jr.: ( 02:25:03 ) Fortunately, as the virus began to spread, the president acted quickly and insured ventilators got the hospitals that needed them most. He delivered PP and E to our brave frontline workers and he rallied the mighty American private sector to tackle this new challenge. There’s more work to do, but there is a light at the end of the tunnel. Job gains are outpacing what the so called experts expected, but Biden’s radical left wing policies would stop our economic recovery cold. He’s already talking about shutting the country down again. It’s madness. Democrats claim to be for workers, but they’ve spent the entire pandemic trying to sneak a tax break for millionaires and Democrat States, into the COVID relief bill. Then they attacked my father for suspending the payroll tax for middle class workers. In fact, if you think about it, Joe Biden’s entire economic platform seems designed to crush the working men and women.  Donald Trump Jr.: ( 02:26:03 ) He supported the worst trade deals in the history of the planet. He voted for the NAFTA nightmare. Down the tubes went our auto industry. He pushed for TPP. Goodbye manufacturing jobs. Beijing Biden is so weak on China, that the intelligence community recently assessed that the Chinese Communist Party favors Biden. They know he’ll weaken us both economically and on a world stage. Biden also wants to bring in more illegal immigrants to take jobs from American citizens. His open border policies would drive wages down for Americans at a time when low income workers were getting real wage increases for the first time in modern history. He’s pledged to repeal the Trump tax cuts, which were the biggest in our country. After eight years of Obama and Biden’s slow growth, Trump’s policies have been like rocket fuel to the economy and especially to the middle class. Biden has promised to take that money back out of your pocket and keep it in the swamp. That makes sense though, considering Joe Biden is basically the Loch Ness Monster of the swamp.  Donald Trump Jr.: ( 02:27:14 ) For the past half century, he’s been lurking around in there. He sticks his head up every now and then to run for president, then he disappears and doesn’t do much in between. So if you’re looking for hope, look to the man who did what the failed Obama Biden administration never could do and built the greatest economy our country has ever seen. And President Trump will do it again. We will be stronger than ever because when we put our mind to it, there is no obstacle that America can’t surmount, except there’s a difference this time. In the past, both parties believed in the goodness of America. We agreed on where we wanted to go, we just disagreed on how to get there. This time, the other party is attacking the very principles on which our nation was founded. Freedom of thought, freedom of speech, freedom of religion, the rule of the law. Thomas Jefferson famously said, “I have sworn upon the altar of God, eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind of man.” Our founders believed there was nothing more important than protecting our God given right to think for ourselves.  Donald Trump Jr.: ( 02:28:29 ) Now the left, they’re trying to cancel all of those founders. They don’t seem to understand this important principle, in order to improve in the future, we must learn from our past, not erase it. So we’re not going to tear down monuments and forget the people who built our great nation. Instead, we will learn from our past so we don’t repeat any mistakes and we will work tirelessly to improve lives of all Americans. Joe Biden, and the radical left are now coming for our freedom of speech. They want to bully us into submission. If they get their way, it will no longer be the silent majority, it will be the silenced majority. This has to stop. Freedom of expression used to be a liberal value, at least before the radical left took over. Now the Republican party is the home of free speech. The place where anyone from any background can speak their mind and may the best ideas win.  Donald Trump Jr.: ( 02:29:31 ) People of faith are under attack. You’re not allowed to go to church, but mass chaos in the streets gets a pass. It’s almost like this election is shaping up to be church, work and school versus rioting, looting, and vandalism, or in the words of Biden and the Democrats, peaceful protesting. Anarchists have been flooding our streets and Democrat mayors are ordering the police to stand down. Small businesses across America, many of them minority owned, are being torched by mobs. The Democrat mayors pretend it’s not happening. They actually called it a summer of love.  Donald Trump Jr.: ( 02:30:13 ) And that brings me to another important principle. Every American must be free to live without fear of violence in your country, in your communities and in your homes. All men and women are created equal and must be treated equally under the law. That’s why we must put an end to racism and we must ensure that any police officer who abuses their powers, is held accountable. What happened to George Floyd is a disgrace and if you know a police officer, you know they agree with that too, but we cannot lose sight of the fact that our police are American heroes. They deserve our deepest appreciation because no matter what the Democrats say, you and I both know when we dial 911, we don’t want it going to voicemail. So defunding the police is not an option. Everything starts with safety and security. You can’t have anything else without it.  Donald Trump Jr.: ( 02:31:11 ) You can’t focus on building a better future for your children, without the peace of mind that they can study safely in their classrooms, play safely in their neighborhoods and sleep safely in their beds. But safety is only the beginning. Trump’s America is a land of opportunity, a place of promise. I was fortunate enough to grow up in a family that could afford the best schools and the finest universities, but a great education can not be the exclusive right of the rich and powerful. It must be accessible to all. And that’s why my dad is pro school choice. That’s why he’s called education access the civil rights issue, not just of our time, but of all time. It is unacceptable that too many African American and Hispanic American children are stuck in bad schools, just because of their zip code. Donald Trump will not stand for it. If Democrats really wanted to help minorities in underserved communities, instead of bowing to big money union bosses, they’d let parents choose what school is best for their kids.  Donald Trump Jr.: ( 02:32:17 ) They’d limit immigration to protect American workers. They’d support the police who protect our neighborhoods. They’d learn how to negotiate trade deals that prioritize America’s interest for a change. They’d end the endless wars and quit sending our young people to solve problems in foreign lands. They’d cut taxes for families and workers. They’d create opportunity zones that drive investment into inner cities. In other words, if Democrats cared for the forgotten men and women of our country, they’d do exactly what President Trump is doing. America is the greatest country on earth, but my father’s entire worldview revolves around the idea that we can always do even better. Imagine the life you want to have, one with a great job, a beautiful home, a perfect family, you can have it. Imagine the country you want to live in, one with true equal opportunity, where hard work pays off and justice is serve with compassion and without partiality, you can have it.  Donald Trump Jr.: ( 02:33:26 ) Imagine a world where the evils of communism and radical Islamic terrorism are not given a chance to spread, where heroes are celebrated and the good guys win, you can have it. That is the life, that is the country, that is the world that Donald Trump and the Republican party are after. And yes, you can have it because unlike Joe Biden and the radical left Democrats, our party is open to everyone. It starts by rejecting radicals who want to drag us into the dark and embracing the man who represents a bright and beautiful future for all. It starts by reelecting Donald J. Trump, president of the United States. Thank you and God bless America.  Catalina Lauf: ( 02:34:23 ) I’m Catalina Lauf, I work in the political space.  Madeline Lauf: ( 02:34:27 ) And I’m Madeline Lauf, and I’m the founder of Begin Health, a children’s nutritional company.  Catalina Lauf: ( 02:34:33 ) We grew up in a really small town outside of Chicago.  Madeline Lauf: ( 02:34:35 ) Our mom’s from Guatemala, our dad’s a small business owner from Chicago and so he brought two different cultures together to create us, a little bit of crazy and …  Catalina Lauf: ( 02:34:47 ) A little bit of fun, I guess. They taught us the values of hard work, liberty, to love this country unapologetically. Our dad is a beekeeper and just had so many different things out in the countryside and it was just such a sweet, quaint-  Madeline Lauf: ( 02:35:02 ) We grew up selling honey at farmer’s markets. So my line was, “Have you ever been stung by a bee?” But really it was teaching us again, entrepreneurship, small business, self-reliance and that we’re the ones that need to put in the hard work to get what we want.  Catalina Lauf: ( 02:35:23 ) And my mother being from Guatemala, escaping what she had there, growing up in poverty and coming here to the United States, being able to fulfill her destiny and be somebody that she couldn’t, there in her home country.  Madeline Lauf: ( 02:35:39 ) And they really instilled in us the sense of purpose, but also self-accountability and that we had to strive to do the things that we wanted and it was up to us to make those things happen.  Catalina Lauf: ( 02:35:52 ) In America, there’s no ceiling of opportunity, you define your own destiny through personal responsibility, through hard work, through having a moral value system. That’s the American dream and President Trump’s providing that for everybody.  Madeline Lauf: ( 02:36:09 ) Look at my business, Begin Health, as a small startup that is growing and launching, we are constantly trying to innovate and the big challenge that COVID brought that we just didn’t see coming, was that just almost everything just shut down. And when you are a small startup and you have limited funding and the funding is really only to get you to that next milestone, we were really struggling. And so we were able to apply for a PPP loan, which really helped allow us to continue hiring and working and developing our products so that we could ultimately still launch.  Catalina Lauf: ( 02:36:46 ) It’s now more than ever so important to have a president and administration that understands that small business is the backbone of our economy. Tax cuts and jobs act was huge, manufacturing, deregulation, fair trade, these are things that affected real Americans. We have a champion in the Oval Office who has this business background. He actually understands the need for small businesses like my sisters, to survive. We aren’t the stereotypical conservative, I mean, we come from Hispanic descent and we’re millennial women, and that’s not what the media wants. And so somebody like AOC, Alexandria Ocasio- Cortez, this far left, these women come out with these very, very destructive political ideologies that are trying to infiltrate millennials and the next generation. I’ve decided to step up and say, “Well, we need a counter voice to these women.”  Madeline Lauf: ( 02:37:47 ) There has been an assault on capitalism just generally and I think it’s very scary to imagine a Biden world where the progressive wing ideas are starting to take front and center stage. That will really choke the American economy. There will be over-regulation, over taxation, it’s very hard to innovate through those two things. And ultimately what’s really sad is the thought of making all of us dependent on the government and we are not going to allow that.  Catalina Lauf: ( 02:38:21 ) I’ve seen a lot of moderates, a lot of people now changing over because of everything that’s been happening. This is a taste of Biden’s America. I mean the rioting, the crime, freedom is at stake now, and this is going to be the most important election of our lifetime. We want to preserve the America that our mother came here for, having a thriving economy, that is keeping America great and President Trump has delivered on that promise. He’s truly fighting for the American people. We’re the greatest country in the world period. On our worst day, we’re still the greatest country in the world and in order to preserve that it’s by putting America first, having a thriving economy, having happiness.  Sen. Tim Scott: ( 02:39:19 ) Good evening, I’m Senator Tim Scott from the great state of South Carolina. To all of you tuning in and participating in the political process, God bless you. This isn’t how I pictured tonight, but our country is experiencing something none of us envisioned, from a global pandemic, to the deaths of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor, 2020 has tested our nation in ways we haven’t seen for decades. But regardless of the challenges presented to us, every four years, Americans come together to vote, to share stories of what makes our nation strong and the lessons we have learned that can strengthen it for further generations. Because while this election is between Donald Trump and Joe Biden, it is not solely about Donald Trump and Joe Biden. It’s about the promise of America, it’s about you and me, our challenges and heartbreaks, hopes and dreams. It’s about how we respond when tackling critical issues like police reform.  Sen. Tim Scott: ( 02:40:20 ) When Democrats called our work a token effort and walked out of the room during negotiations, because they wanted the issue more than they wanted a solution. Do we want a society that breeds success or a culture that cancels everything it even slightly disagrees with? I know where I stand because you see, I am living my mother’s American dream. My parents divorced when I was seven years old and we moved in with my grandparents into a two bedroom home, with me, my mom and my brother sharing a room and one bed. My mom worked 16 hours a day to keep food on the table and a roof over our heads. She knew that if we could find the opportunity, bigger things would come. I thought I had to use football to succeed in life and my focus on academics faded away. My freshman year, I failed out, I failed four subjects, Spanish, English, world geography, and even civics.  Sen. Tim Scott: ( 02:41:22 ) Trust me though, after seven years in the Senate, I know I’m not the only one in Congress who failed civics. But even while I was failing the ninth grade, my mother always said to me, “Timmy, if you would just shoot for the moon, even if you miss, you’ll be among the stars.” She never lost faith in me, even when I lost faith in myself. Because of her encouragement, I went to summer school and caught up. The next year, I met my mentor, John [Monice 00:21:55], a Chick-fil-A operator. John saw something in me that I could not see in myself and started teaching me valuable life lessons, like having a job would be a good thing, but creating jobs would be even better. That having an income could change my lifestyle, but creating a profit could change my community.  Sen. Tim Scott: ( 02:42:17 ) He planted the seeds of what would become opportunity zones. This initiative that the president and I worked together on, is now bringing more than $75 billion of private sector investment into distressed communities. I took those lessons to heart and started putting the pieces of my life back together. I realized a quality education is the closest thing to magic in America. That’s why I fight to this day for school choice, to make sure every child in every neighborhood has a quality education. I don’t care if it’s a public, private, charter, virtual or a homeschool, when a parent has a choice, their kid has a better chance and the president has fought alongside me on that. Later in life, I started my own small business, that’s why I know it is critical for us to have a tax code that encourages growth.  Sen. Tim Scott: ( 02:43:18 ) We actually saw revenues to the treasury increase after we lowered taxes in 2017, rested assured the Democrats do not want you to know that. After starting my small business and spending some time in local government, I decided to run for Congress in 2010. The district is based in Charleston, South Carolina, where the Civil War started, against a son of our legendary Senator, Strom Thurmond. You may be asking yourself, how does a poor black kid from a single parent household, run and win in a race crowded with Republicans, against a Thurmond, because of the evolution of the Southern heart. In an overwhelmingly white district, the voters judged me not on the color of my skin, but on the content of my character. We live in a world that only wants you to believe in the bad news, racially, economically, and culturally polarizing news. The truth is our nations arc always bins back towards fairness. We are not fully where we want to be, but I thank God almighty, we’re not where we used to be.  Sen. Tim Scott: ( 02:44:38 ) We are always striving to be better. When we stumble and we will, we pick ourselves back up and try again. We don’t give in to cancel culture or the radical and factually baseless belief that things are worse today than in the 1860s or the 1960s. We have work to do, but I believe in the goodness of America, the promise that all men and all women are created equal and if you’re watching tonight, I’m betting you do too. Over the past four years, we have made tremendous progress towards that promise. President Trump built the most inclusive economy ever. Seven million jobs created pre COVID-19 and two thirds of them went to women, African Americans and Hispanics. The first new major effort to tackle poverty in a generation, opportunity zones. We put hard earned tax dollars back in people’s pockets by cutting their taxes, especially for single parent households like the one I grew up in, cutting single mothers taxes, 70% on average.  Sen. Tim Scott: ( 02:45:58 ) President Trump supported these tax cuts for those single moms and other working families and signed these policies into law and our nation is better off for it. So I’m going to ask you, the American people, not to simply look at what the candidates say, but to look back at what they’ve done. This election is about your future and it is critical to paint a full picture of the records of Donald Trump and Joe Biden. Joe Biden said if a black man didn’t vote for him, he wasn’t truly black. Joe Biden said black people are a monolithic community. It was Joe Biden who said poor kids can be just as smart as white kids. And while his words are one thing, his actions take it to a whole new level. In 1994, Biden led the charge on a crime bill that put millions of black Americans behind bars, President Trump’s criminal justice reform law, fixed many of the disparities Biden created and made our system more fair and just for all Americans.  Sen. Tim Scott: ( 02:47:14 ) Joe Biden also failed our nation’s historically black colleges and universities, heaping blame on them as they fought to ensure our young folks had access to higher education. Once again, to clean up Joe Biden’s mess, President Trump signed into law historically high funding for HBCUs, as well as a bill to give them permanent funding for the first time ever. And now in Joe Biden wants to come for your pocket books, unless of course, you’re a blue state millionaire. I’m serious, that’s one of their solutions for the pandemic. They want to take more money from your pocket and give it to Manhattan elites and Hollywood moguls, so they get a tax break. Republicans however, passed President Trump’s once in a generation tax reform bill, that lowered taxes for single moms, working families and those in need. So when it comes to what Joe Biden says he’ll do, look at his actions, look at his policies, look at what he already did and what he didn’t do while he’s been in Washington for 47 years.  Sen. Tim Scott: ( 02:48:37 ) Ladies and gentlemen, people don’t always see those failures because they think we’re having a policy debate on two sides of an issue, that is not what is happening. Our side is working on policy, while Joe Biden’s radical Democrats are trying to permanently transform what it means to be an American. Make no mistake, Joe Biden and Kamala Harris want a cultural revolution, a fundamentally different America. If we let them, they will turn our country into a socialist utopia. And history has taught us that path only leads to pain and misery, especially for hardworking people hoping to rise. Instead, we must focus on the promise of the American journey. I know that journey well. My grandfather’s 99th birthday would have been tomorrow. Growing up he had to cross the street if a white person was coming, he suffered the indignity of being forced out of school as a third grader to pick cotton and he never learned to read or write.  Sen. Tim Scott: ( 02:49:55 ) Yet, he lived long enough to see his grandson become the first African American to be elected to both the United States House and the United States Senate, in the history of this country. Our family went from cotton to Congress in one lifetime and that’s why I believe the next American century can be better than the last. There are millions of families just like mine, all across this nation, full of potential, seeking to live the American dream. And I’m here tonight to tell you that supporting the Republican ticket, gives you the best chance of making that dream a reality. God bless you and father, please continue blessing the United States of America. God bless.

Speaker 1: ( 00:00 ) We hold these truths to be self evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. Without life, there can be no liberty. Without liberty, there is no happiness. Without equality, there is no opportunity. America has strived, since its founding to promote equality under the law, to correct injustices and to ensure opportunity for all. It is a work in progress, not always perfect. Some look at American opportunity and see only problems. They want equal outcome, not equal opportunities. They criticize without solutions, demand wealth without work. Their ways are historical failures, evidenced by tyranny and poverty, a prevailing darkness in every country that has been tried. The American dream, inspired by American opportunity is the engine of entrepreneurship.  Speaker 2: ( 02:06 ) Oh, it’s beautiful, Mike.  Speaker 1: ( 02:08 ) The inspiration to the greatest inventions, the highest achievements, and establishing a quality of life, second to none. Providing jobs, creating futures, fulfilling dreams. In America, opportunity preserves individual freedom. It Leads to exceptionalism. It’s a bright shining light, an example for all to see. Tonight, we explore together. America, land of opportunity.  Speaker 3: ( 03:02 ) From Washington D C, welcome to the 2020 Republican National Convention. Tonight, celebrating America as the land of opportunity.  Speaker 4: ( 03:11 ) I’m going to invite you to join your faith with mine, and let’s pray in agreement. Lord, we come before you to ask for your spirit of peace to come over hurting communities in Wisconsin tonight. We pray for healing and comfort to Jacob Blake and his family. We pray for your protection over those who put their lives in harm’s way, to bring safety and security to our streets. We pray that the truth and justice will be at the heart of all decisions that are made by our leaders, and that we, as a people will seek reconciliation with you, as we do the same with each other. Thank you Lord, for your goodness over our lives, for your blessing over our nation, for your guiding hand over every person that calls the United States of America their home. Lord, we thank you for all that have gone before us and have sowed seeds of sacrifice, for our freedom, for our prosperity and for our peace, those that gave their lives so that we could live and achieve the American dream.  Speaker 4: ( 04:48 ) Your word declares in second Corinthians, “Where the spirit of the Lord is there is freedom.” This country was founded by the people, for their God. Liberty, freedom, equality, it’s what we want in our country. Lord, we invite you into our homes, into our lives. Give us revelation that will overthrow any enemies that stand against us so that we will be victorious in this next season. We need you. Let your kingdom come. Let your will be done on earth, as it is in heaven. We surrender to your plans and purpose for our lives. We ask, bring heaven down to earth, over every person here and all those watching today. As we move into this next chapter in our journey to greatness, we ask for your presence to be with us. Lead us, Lord. Give us strategies from heaven. I decree the words of Isaiah 11:2, over our President, Vice-President and all government authorities from every state in our nation.  Speaker 4: ( 05:58 ) May the spirit of the Lord rests on him, the spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel and might, the spirit of knowledge and the fear of the Lord. I release a blessing over every person and every home, Lord release health, healing, peace, strength, and courage. Let us stand together in unity, as we embrace another chapter on our journey to greatness. I decree and declare America, the best is yet to come. I ask all this in the name of Jesus. Amen.  Speaker 4: ( 06:40 ) I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all  Speaker 5: ( 06:58 ) [Foreign language 00:06:58] I’m Myron Lizer, the Vice-President of the Navajo Nation. I give this address from the majestic rock spires of Shiprock, Tsé Bitʼaʼí, or Rock with Wings, as known by our Dene people. It is here as well, that many of our ancestral leaders sought to govern and lead a nation within a nation. They sought to lead their people into the promises of a better way of life for their children’s children. It is also where they have not been as successful as the rest of America. Our First Nations people, the host people of the land, we are still here. Our creator placed us here and knew, for such a time as this, we would have an opportunity for an appeal to heaven. You see, our people have never been invited into the American dream. We, for years fought congressional battles with past congressmen and senators, that were part of a broken system that ignored us.  Speaker 5: ( 07:47 ) That is, until president Trump took office. President Trump delivered the largest financial funding package ever to Indian country. The $8 billion in CARE Act funding to Indian country was a great start in alleviating the devastating effects that the COVID-19 pandemic has inflicted on our Indian tribes. The Navajo nation once led the nation in per-capita positive cases, because of the health disparities that previous administrations failed to improve. Whenever we meet with President Trump, he has always made it a priority to repair the relationship with our federal family. Recently, President Trump signed the first- ever presidential proclamation, officially recognizing, missing and murdered American Indians and Alaska natives.  Speaker 5: ( 08:29 ) He established a taskforce called Operation Lady Justice, to address the problem. The president also provided $273 million to improve public safety and support victims of crime in the Native American community. As a result, a cold-case office was recently opened on the Gila River Indian community. The president has reactivated the White House Council on Native American Affairs, to promote economic development and rural prosperity in the Indian country. President Trump also strengthened the Supreme Court by nominating strong conservative judges like Neil Gorsuch, who supports Native American rights. Thank you for the opportunity to be here tonight. I’m excited to endorse President Trump’s reelection and Mr. President, we look forward to hosting you very soon. Come visit our land, we call it Dinehtah. [Foreign language 00:09:18] Thank you, very much.  Jon Ponder: ( 09:21 ) I had always had this unshakeable sense that I know that I know, that life has to be more than what it was I’ve been living. I caught my very first felony conviction at 16 years old, and that type of behavior had led me into more and more arrests, getting in trouble until the age of 37 years old. I was arrested for a string of bank robberies and based off of my criminal history, there is a potential that a federal judge can sentence me up to 23 years in a maximum security United States, federal penitentiary. In that moment, I played a let’s make a deal with God. I asked God to climb into the robe of that judge, whether it’s 10 years or 50 years, I’m going to invest the rest of my life serving you. I stood before that federal judge. Judge Meehan took his glasses off, leaned back and said, “I don’t know why I’m going to do this,” but he said, “I’m not going to give you what you deserve.”  Jon Ponder: ( 10:28 ) Then, he gave me a lesser sentence. As I laid on that stainless steel cell, shackled by my hands and my feet, I heard God utter into my spirit. “My son, I honored which you asked me to do.” He said, “Never forget the promise that you made to me.” Ever since that day I got up off that floor and my life went in 180 degree turn in the other direction.  Richard Beasly: ( 11:01 ) When John got that sentence, I just shook my head. I said, “Wow. John, you are destined for bigger things than prison.”  Richard Beasly: ( 11:09 ) My name is Richard Beasley. I was a FBI special agent for about 25 and a half years.  Jon Ponder: ( 11:15 ) It was something about his demeanor, when he walked into that room, I had this feeling like everything’s going to be okay.  Richard Beasly: ( 11:21 ) Then when he got out, he gave me a call and says, “Hey, Rich, let’s have lunch. I met him at a McDonald’s and he’s got a Bible with him. I’ve seen that before, where guys have used the Bible as a prop, it took me about 30 seconds to understand that this was not a prop with Jon. He was a changed guy from the man that I arrested, several years before.  Jon Ponder: ( 11:41 ) When I saw the way that he treated me fairly, I saw the man behind the suit. I started thinking, “Man, if that worked for me with this law enforcement officer, how can I multiply that and get more law enforcement officers involved, so that we can impact on a larger scale? President Trump, he had made a bunch of promises. Let me just be transparent. When he first started talking about the things he was going to do, I’m sitting there going, wait a minute here. I mean, is he serious, because everything that he was saying that he wanted to do was the stuff that needs to be done. Before he walked out of that meeting that day, I promise I’ll make it out there to come speak at one of your graduations. I heard that they were phenomenal.  Jon Ponder: ( 12:33 ) When he stood there in that graduation, and he went out of his way to shake the hand of every one of those 29 graduates, it set them on a whole another Vista of life, because they had the office of the President of the United States. The promises that he made, was promises that he kept.  Donald Trump: ( 13:02 ) Two years ago, I was honored to tell John Ponder’s story of transformation in the Rose Garden, on the National Day of Prayer. Today, I’m thrilled to welcome him back to the White House. John’s life is a beautiful testament to the power of redemption. John grew up without his father. As he tells it, my mother was strong, but she wasn’t able to keep us out of the gangs and off of the streets, and they were violent streets. At the age of 38, he was arrested for bank robbery. While Jon was in prison, he began reading the Bible and listening to Christian radio. One day he heard Reverend Billy Graham on the radio proclaim, “Jesus wants to be Lord of your life”. On that day, Jon dedicated his life to Christ. He spent the rest of his time in prison, studying the Bible. When he was released, he heard a knock at his door.  Donald Trump: ( 13:56 ) It was the officer who put him in jail, FBI Special Agent Richard Beasley, who said, “I want you to know that I’ve been praying for you.” Now, Richard and John are best friends and we are grateful that Richard is here with us today. In the last 10 years, since Jon was released, he has created one of the most successful reentry programs, Hope for Prisoners, in Las Vegas. I was led to speak there earlier this year. As Jon says, Hope for Prisoners is a movement that began as a dream ,in a tiny prison cell and is now making a difference in the lives of thousands, truly bringing a hope that there is an opportunity and a community that is waiting and willing to offer them a second chance.  Donald Trump: ( 14:41 ) Jon, we honor your devotion to showing returning citizens that they are not forgotten. We believe that each person is made by God for a purpose. I will continue to give all Americans, including former inmates, the best chance to build a new life and achieve their own American dream and a great American dream it is. Now, I’d like to ask John and Richard to say a few words.  Jon Ponder: ( 15:08 ) I can’t tell you how grateful I am to have the opportunity to speak here today. Not so long ago, my life was running from the police, fearing the police and avoiding the police. Not because of anything that the police had done to me personally, but due to the animosity I had allowed to grow inside of me, making me believe that they were my enemy. But today, praise God, I am filled with hope, a proud American citizen who has been given a second chance. My transformation began in a prison cell where I’ve found myself a three-time convicted felon, facing yet another sentence. I gave my life to Jesus and made him a promise that I would spend the rest of my days helping the others like me. My first help and support came from the unlikeliest of places, the FBI agent who arrested me, Richard Beasley. He is now a dear friend and has been a source of encouragement to me throughout my entire journey.  Jon Ponder: ( 16:06 ) I am grateful for the men and women of the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department, who volunteer their time to people who return into our local community after incarceration. These are the real-life heroes who put their lives on the line every day, armed with the promise that they made to protect and to serve, have made a tremendous impact in the lives of men and women we integrating back into our society. My hope for America is that formerly incarcerated people will be afforded the opportunity to take advantage of the fact that we live in a nation of second chances. My hope for America is that law enforcement and people in the communities across our country can come together and realize that as Americans, we have more in common than we have differences. My hope for our great nation is to continue on this path we are on of being the most prosperous country in the world.  Richard Beasly: ( 17:01 ) I’m so proud of John with his life’s around and for all the lives that he’s helped to change. It may be hard to believe that as a retired FBI agent, one of my best friends is a person that arrested for bank robbery. When I met John 15 years ago, he was angry, scared, frustrated, and anxious about his future. On the drive to prison. I stopped at a convenience store and buy Jon a coffee and a donut. After he was sentenced, Jon sent me a neck tie and a note, thanking me for treating him like a gentlemen. Five years later, when he got out of prison, Jon called me and wanted to meet for lunch. He was a different man. He talked about starting a reentry program for men and women coming out of prison. Over time, Jon earned the trust and respect of the law enforcement community, many of whom volunteer in Jon’s Hope for Prisoners Program.  Richard Beasly: ( 17:47 ) I’m grateful for President Trump’s commitment to criminal justice reform. On February 20th of this year, he was the guest speaker at the Hope For Prisoners graduation. He stayed much longer than scheduled to hand out diplomas to the 29 men and women who graduated that day. What a sight. The most important man in the free world, shaking hands and pledging his administration support to ex-offenders. Their families were there. The community was there. What a great second chance. I also appreciate President Trump’s support for law enforcement. I always felt like I had strong support as an FBI agent, but there’s nothing worse than knowing you’re being second-guessed when you’re doing your job. In certain parts of our country right now, law enforcement doesn’t feel like they have the support from their local leaders. They’re being painted with a broad brush, unfairly, with calls for de-funding.  Richard Beasly: ( 18:36 ) But, as President Trump knows, the overwhelming percentage of law enforcement officers are good, smart people who are doing their jobs very well and they can change the world, working with people like Jon. Thank you.  Donald Trump: ( 18:49 ) Now, I’d like to invite Jon’s wife, Jamie, to join us as I grant Jon, I’m not sure you know this, a full pardon. I don’t know if you know that Jamie. Come on over here. It’s just an honor. You have done incredible work.  Jon Ponder: ( 19:07 ) Thank you, sir.  Donald Trump: ( 19:08 ) All of Las Vegas and all of Nevada and all of every place in this country is very proud of you the job you’ve done, bringing people back. You’re right. I was supposed to be there for five minutes. I stayed for an hour and a half-  Jamie Ponder: ( 19:20 ) He did.  Donald Trump: ( 19:21 ) Because it was so interesting to me. Congratulations-  Jamie Ponder: ( 19:24 ) Thank you.  Donald Trump: ( 19:24 ) … to both of you, sir.  Jamie Ponder: ( 19:25 ) Thank you.  Donald Trump: ( 19:25 ) Richard, thank you very much for the job you do.  Richard Blakey: ( 19:27 ) Thank you, Mr. President.  Donald Trump: ( 19:28 ) Fantastic.  Richard Blakey: ( 19:28 ) Thank you.  Donald Trump: ( 19:39 ) Okay. I think I ‘ll give it to Jamie. What do you think?  Rand Paul: ( 19:58 ) Good evening. I’m Senator Rand Paul from Kentucky. Donald Trump and I met many years ago, before he was running for anything. When I first met him, I recall being struck by how down to earth he was. He seemed like just a normal guy. Okay, a normal guy with his own plane and helicopter, but who’s counting? I was planning a medical mission trip to Guatemala to perform charity eye surgeries, and we needed money to fund the trip. Donald Trump offered to help and immediately came through for us. Not only did he support my medical mission to Guatemala, but he also contributed to another mission trip to Haiti, a year later. We performed hundreds of cataract surgeries in both countries. Nothing is more amazing than removing the bandages from a person’s eyes and watching them as they see their loved ones again.  Rand Paul: ( 20:48 ) Donald Trump helped me make that happen. A few years later, we were opponents, both running for president, and we all know how that turned out. But I’m proud of the job Donald Trump has done as president. I don’t always agree with him, but our occasional policy differences are far outweighed by our significant agreements. But more important than simple agreement is accomplishment. President Trump gets things done. When some in Congress wanted a so-called revenue-neutral tax plan, Donald Trump and I worked together to make sure that it was a true tax cut. I brought President Trump an idea for better, less expensive health insurance called Association Health Plans. Donald Trump overturned years of red tape and bureaucrats, and he made it happen. While others talked about criminal justice reform, President Trump actually signed the First Step Act. The first real reform in a generation and one that sought to undo the harm that others, like Joe Biden. Have done for those of us who lament the Biden crime bill that locked up a generation of young black men, remember that Biden bragged about a bill that still wreaks havoc among people of color.  Rand Paul: ( 22:10 ) I’m supporting President Trump because he believes, as I do, that a strong America cannot fight endless wars. We must not continue to leave our blood and treasure in Middle East quagmires. I flew with him to Dover Air Force base, to honor two soldiers whose remains were coming home from Afghanistan. I’ll never forget that evening. I can tell you the president not only felt the pain of these families, but that the president is committed to ending this war. President Trump is the first president in a generation to seek to end war, rather than start one. He intends to end the war in Afghanistan. He is bringing our men and women home. Madison once wrote, “No nation can preserve its freedom in the midst of continuous warfare.” I’m proud to finally see a president who agrees with that. Compare president Trump with the disastrous record of Joe Biden, who’s consistently called for more war.  Rand Paul: ( 23:11 ) Joe Biden voted for the Iraq war, which president Trump has long-called the worst geopolitical mistake of our generation. I fear Biden will choose war again. He supported the war in Serbia, Syria, Libya. Joe Biden will continue to spill our blood and treasure. President trump will bring our heroes home. If you hate war, like I hate war, if you want us to quit sending $50 billion every year to Afghanistan to build their roads and bridges, instead of building them here at home, you need to support President Trump for another term. To our soldiers and their families, join me in supporting President Trump. To those of you who want lower taxes and better, less expensive healthcare, join me in supporting President Trump.  Rand Paul: ( 24:05 ) To those of you who want to stand up and fight the socialists poisoning our schools and burning our cities, join me in supporting President Trump. Let’s rebuild America together.  Speaker 6: ( 24:37 ) What I would call your everyday man, the forgotten man or woman, the people that wake up every morning go to work, do their job, come home to their kids and families and are faithful and consistent. The people that have built America.  Speaker 7: ( 24:54 ) There are people in our country that have been forgotten, that are hard workers. We do not hold signs. We are not on street corners. We are waking up at the crack of dawn, working and earning our living.  Speaker 8: ( 25:12 ) But every single day, men and women from across this country are affecting people in positive ways.  Speaker 9: ( 25:20 ) Real people that work hard every day, and they just want to earn a good living and enjoy life.  Speaker 6: ( 25:31 ) He really knows them, understands them. It’s clear, he has been on the job site, interacting with people from all backgrounds.  Speaker 7: ( 25:41 ) I’ve never had someone care so much about making sure people have some job security.  Speaker 10: ( 25:50 ) The president’s job is to protect us, keep us safe and help make our life better, and the opportunity to pursue the American dream. That’s what Donald Trump is doing.  Speaker 7: ( 26:01 ) As a cattle rancher and a farmer, I do feel that we are not forgotten with this administration. We have hope for preserving our industry.  Speaker 11: ( 26:13 ) My hope is that we lift the regulations that have stripped away the working class American’s ability to do what they innately, know how to do best.  Speaker 12: ( 26:24 ) I felt like Trump is definitely pushing more for the steel mills, the fishermen, just us making our own products and bringing everything in. He’s pushing so hard, and I see it truly coming alive.  Speaker 13: ( 26:39 ) I do feel that President Trump has the interests of all those Americans tied together. I really do.  Jason Joyce: ( 26:54 ) Good evening. My name is Jason Joyce, and I’m an eighth- generation lobster fishermen from Swan’s Island, Maine. I make my living from lobster fishing, oyster farming and providing eco tours in the beautiful waters near Acadia National Park, where I have over 200 years of family history. I have to confess I didn’t support Trump in 2016, skeptical that he shared my conservative views, I expected him to flip flop on his campaign promises, but he has followed through on his promises including last week when he brokered a deal to end European Union tariffs of 8% on main live lobsters and up to 20% on main lobster products, which is great news for Maine’s lobster men and women. I live in an island with 370 residents and lobstering is how we provide for our families.  Jason Joyce: ( 27:40 ) Maine’s lobsterman are true environmentalist. We practice conservation every day. If we didn’t, we’d be putting ourselves out of business. Four years ago, the Obama-Biden administration used the Antiquities Act to order thousands of square miles of ocean off limits to commercial fishermen. They did it to cater to environmental activists. Although Maine’s lobstermen, don’t fish, there Obama’s executive order offended us greatly. It circumvented the Fisheries Counsel’s input. President Trump reversed that decision, reinstating the rules that allow stakeholder input. he supports a process that seeks and respects fisherman’s views. As long as Trump is president, fishing families like mine will have a voice, but if Biden wins, he’ll be controlled by the environmental extremists who want to circumvent longstanding rules and impose radical changes that hurt our coastal communities.  Jason Joyce: ( 28:34 ) I strongly support President Trump’s reelection. When he sees something isn’t right, he’s fearless in fixing it. He listens to working people. He nominates judges who respect the constitution and the right to life. He keeps his word, like eliminating the European tariffs and moving the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. I hope you will join me this time in voting for President Trump. Stand up for your country. Thank you.  Chris Pearson: ( 29:15 ) Good evening. My name is Chris Peterson. My husband, Gary, our family, and I milk a thousand cows on a dairy farm in Grantsburg Wisconsin, a small middle-American town. Truth be told, until I married my cute farmer from Grantsburg a long time ago, I was a city slicker from Minneapolis, which is about 70 miles south of us. Donald Trump became president in the middle of the great depression for dairy farmers in Wisconsin. In 2016, prices were horrible and longtime generational farms across the nation were going out of business. In 2017, our 120- year old barn, which served as our milking center, caught fire and burned to the ground. Our cows were spared, but because they needed to be milked three times a day, farmers, friends, and complete strangers from all over Northern Wisconsin helped haul them to other farms where they stayed until we could rebuild. By the end of 2018, we had a new state-of-the-art robotic milking facility that allows our cows to milk themselves three times a day.  Chris Pearson: ( 30:23 ) At about the same time, President Trump’s economic boon began helping dairy farmers across the nation. As a businessman, President Trump understands that farming is a complicated, capital-intensive and risky business. More than any president in my lifetime, he has acknowledged the importance of farmers and agriculture. That support and focus on negotiating new trade deals, gave us the confidence to rebuild our barn and dairy operation. Business was booming again and business boomed bright until the COVID-19 shutdown in March. Many people probably don’t realize that our country is one of the few in the world that produces nearly all of its own food.  Chris Pearson: ( 31:05 ) Fewer still, understand how close our food production and distribution system came to collapsing this past spring. But President Trump understood and again, took steps to provide the supports we needed. President Trump took the necessary action. Knowing that agriculture is our backbone and strength, critical to our national security. Our entire economy and dairy farming are once again, roaring back. One person deserves the credit and our vote, President Donald J. Trump.  Speaker 14: ( 31:47 ) What was happening prior to president Trump, you had businesses that were over-regulated and not a friendly environment at all to start a company.  Speaker 15: ( 31:55 ) My family stopped ranching about seven years ago. The regulations became so overbearing that the ranch was slowly sold off.  Speaker 16: ( 32:05 ) I lost businesses because of this regulation.  Speaker 17: ( 32:08 ) The factories in our town closed. The businesses in our towns have shut. It got to the point finally, that middle America needed help.  Speaker 18: ( 32:18 ) President Trump came in and was able to shed light on an area that had been so long left behind.  Speaker 17: ( 32:26 ) Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was huge, especially for a community like ours, that has a lot of small businesses. Manufacturing, deregulation, fair trade.  Speaker 18: ( 32:36 ) Real-life policy changes that affected real Americans.  Speaker 19: ( 32:40 ) An amazing opportunity to get ahead, to have our businesses, to have our children educated, of school choice.  Speaker 20: ( 32:46 ) That is something that’s huge for parents right now, especially black moms, whose kids are trapped in failing school districts.  Speaker 21: ( 32:52 ) Before COVID hit, [inaudible 00:32:54] unemployment rate was at a lowest ever.  Speaker 22: ( 32:55 ) I’ve seen the numbers of employees go up and they’re earning a lot more for their family than what they had previously.  Speaker 23: ( 33:02 ) They’re earning a lot more for their family than what they had previously.  Speaker 24: ( 33:05 ) What this administration has done, simplifying the government, it’s really cut the handcuffs off of America again and allowed us to grow and move forward in a way that I have never seen in my lifetime.  Speaker 25: ( 33:15 ) When you pull regulation and allow small companies to go out there and be able to play in the game, that is the American dream.  Speaker 23: ( 33:23 ) People feel that they can support and have a family and they can build and make us stronger as Americans.  Speaker 26: ( 33:30 ) What could be taken away if he doesn’t win again?  Speaker 27: ( 33:33 ) Joe Biden said the first thing he’s going to do is increase taxes on everyone.  Speaker 25: ( 33:38 ) Over-regulating and making it where a small business can’t grow. That’s taking away the American dream.  Speaker 23: ( 33:44 ) I think with the upcoming election, people just need to think about what is better for them and their family.  Speaker 25: ( 33:51 ) The president’s job is to be the CEO of our country, and he’s doing his job.  Speaker 28: ( 33:58 ) He has improved jobs, he’s improved health, he’s improved wages, he’s cut taxes. I could go on for an hour and a half.  Speaker 29: ( 34:09 ) The plan was working. Everybody had a job, making money, spending money, boom [inaudible 00:34:14] bang, boom, we’re good.  Speaker 23: ( 34:15 ) My kids are going to look up to me and say, “You are the best mom for working, raising us.” It’s just tremendous what I could do.  Speaker 26: ( 34:24 ) This is somebody who loves his country. He’s truly fighting for the American people.  Larry Kudlow: ( 34:31 ) Hello folks. You know me from TV and radio. I’m Larry Kudlow. Years ago, I worked for Ronald Reagan. More recently, I helped the team craft Donald Trump’s economic plan during the campaign. It was a roaring success, inheriting a stagnant economy on the front end of recession. The program of tax cuts, historic rollback of onerous regulations that crippled small business, unleashing energy to become the world’s number one producer, and free, fair, and reciprocal trade deals to bolster manufacturing, agriculture, technology, and other sectors. The economy was rebuilt in three years. Unemployment fell to the lowest rate of 3.5%. Blue collars, African Americans, Hispanics, women, all groups benefited enormously. Everyone was better off. A rising tide lifting all boats. Then came a once in 100 year pandemic. It was awful. Health and economic impacts were tragic, hardship and heartbreak were everywhere. But presidential leadership came swiftly and effectively with an extraordinary rescue for health and safety to successfully fight the COVID virus.  Larry Kudlow: ( 35:47 ) A great bipartisan rescue also saved the economy. Right now, our economic health is coming back. With emergency spending and tax cuts, Americans are going back to work. There’s a housing boom, there’s an auto boom, a manufacturing boom, a consumer spending boom. Stops are in record territory. A V shaped recovery is pointing to better than 20% growth in the second half of this year. Now looking ahead, more tax cuts and regulatory rollback will be in store, payroll tax cuts for higher wages, income tax cuts for the middle class, capital gains tax cuts for investment, productivity, and jobs. Much more regulatory relief for small businesses. In economic terms folks, this is no time for a $4 trillion tax hike. Coming out of the deep pandemic, who in their right mind would pick the pockets of taxpayers and drain money from their wallets and purses?  Larry Kudlow: ( 36:52 ) Look, our economic choice is very clear. Do you want economic health, prosperity, opportunity, and optimism? Or do you want to turn back to the dark days of stagnation, recession and pessimism? I believe there can’t be better economic policies than we’ve had in recent years. So I say, stay with him. Thank you.  John Peterson: ( 37:27 ) I’m John Peterson, owner of a second generation metal fabrication business called Schuette Metals. We’ve been stamping our products and services made in the USA since 1957. My brother and I purchased the business from my uncles almost 38 years ago. What was a 12 person shop has now grown into a company employing 165 people today. Like most companies that are successful over the long run, we had to reinvent ourselves as the market changed. Six years ago, we invested heavily in our business just as a greatest recession appeared. Barack Obama and Joe Biden, two career politicians who knew nothing about business, couldn’t get the government out of our way. And it put our business in a tailspin. Sadly, we were forced to make decisions which included cutting staff, a torturous experience when our employees are like family. The Obama-Biden era banking regulations left us no choice. It tied our lenders hands and deprived us of the lifeblood of our business capital.  John Peterson: ( 38:38 ) We scratched and we clawed for two years, and then everything changed. Donald Trump was elected president and he knew what it was like to build a company and create jobs. One of the first things he did was to cut red tape and put an end to draconian type banking regulations. He also cut taxes on small businesses, allowing us to be more competitive, both domestically and internationally. In fact, we increased revenues by 25% for two years in a row. By getting rid of the job-killing NAFTA and negotiating the US-Mexican-Canada Trade Agreement, president Trump ensured a more competitive playing field for American companies. Even with all the challenges presented by the Coronavirus, president Trump is rebuilding and our economy is roaring back again. But when I hear that Joe Biden is ready to raise taxes, crush us with regulations, and weaken our international trade position, I shudder.  John Peterson: ( 39:47 ) We simply cannot endure a Biden-induced recession. Some will struggle, some will not survive, and working men and women of America will get crushed yet again. This is not time to hand our government over to a washed up career politician who will be nothing but a puppet of the radical left Democrats. As a lifelong resident of Wisconsin, I’m a fan of the Badger Football Team. Many may not realize that the Wisconsin Badgers and the president share three common qualities. They’re smart, they’re tough, and they’re dependable. As a businessman, I can tell you that those qualities we need in our country’s leader, and that’s why we need to reelect Donald .J. Trump. Thank you and God bless America.  Cissie Graham Lynch: ( 41:03 ) Good evening. I’m Cissie Graham Lynch, and I’m honored to speak to you tonight about something that is so important to all of us, our faith. As Americans, we know the first line of the first amendment protects our freedom of religion, but what we often forget, the actual words, are free exercise of religion. That means living out our faith in our daily lives, in our schools, in our jobs and yes, even in the public square. Our founders did not envision a quiet, hidden faith. They fought to ensure that the voices of faith were always welcomed, not silenced, not bullied. But during the Obama-Biden administration, these freedoms were under attack. Democrats tried to make faith organizations pay for abortion-inducing drugs. Democrats tried to force adoption agencies to violate their deeply-held beliefs. Democrats pressured schools to allow boys to compete in girl sports and use girls locker rooms. Those are the facts. But then, we the people elected Donald Trump.  Cissie Graham Lynch: ( 42:20 ) People of faith suddenly had a fierce advocate in the White House. He appointed judges who respect the First Amendment. He supported religious beliefs in court. He ensured religious ministries would not be forced to violate their beliefs. He withdrew the policies that placed our little girls at risk. And on the world stage president Trump became the first president to talk about the importance of religious freedom at the United Nations, giving hope to people of faith around the world. In America, we have not yet experienced physical persecution, even though the left has tried to silence us. Even during the pandemic we saw how quickly life can change. Some Democratic leaders tried to ban church services while marijuana shops and abortion clinics were declared essential. But you know what truly is essential? Our right to worship freely and live our faith in every aspect of life.  Cissie Graham Lynch: ( 43:23 ) The Biden-Harris vision for America leaves no room for people of faith. Whether you’re a baker, a florist, or a football coach, they will force the choice between being obedient to God, or to Caesar, because the radical left’s god is government power. So in the words of my grandfather, Billy Graham, let us stand for political freedom, moral freedom, religious freedom, and the rights of all Americans, and lets never give in to those who would attempt to take it from us. Tonight, I’m proudly standing in that public square and I hope and pray you will join me in voting to reelect president Trump.  Bob Vlaisavljevich: ( 44:10 ) Hi, I’m Bob Vlaisavljevich, mayor of Eveleth, a small town in the Iron Range of Minnesota. My father and grandfather earned their livings mining the raw materials that made the steel that built America. This election is a make or break for workers who are carrying on the legacy of men like them. Since the Iron Range economy is vulnerable to economic trends and to foreign trade, we have always needed a strong voice in Washington. We looked to Democrats to fill that void for many years because we actually thought they cared about our welfare. Not anymore. The radical environmental movement has dragged the Democratic party so far to the left, they can no longer claim to be advocates of the man. This is hard for me to say because I am a lifelong Democrat. But for far too long, members of both parties allowed our country to be ripped off by our trading partners, especially China, who dumped steel into our markets and slapped tariffs on our products. And what did so-called leaders like Joe Biden do? Nothing.  Bob Vlaisavljevich: ( 45:14 ) The human cost has been devastating. We lost thousands of jobs, we lost a generation of young people who had to leave the Iron Range to find a livelihood, and worst of all, we lost hope. Then something unexpected happened. The street- talking New Yorker burst onto the scene promising to stand up to China and the rest of the world on behalf of the American worker. Four years later, the Iron Range is roaring back to life, and we have one man to thank, president Donald Trump. He made good on his promises by cutting our taxes, rolling back senseless regulations, and delivering trade deals that put America’s interests first. But the fight is not over. Joe Biden has allowed radicals like AOC to craft his environmental policies. Their so-called Green New Deal is a job-killing disgrace dreamt up by people who don’t live in the real world. But Biden is too weak, too scared, and too sleepy to stand up to the radical left. He has been doing nothing in Washington for 47 years. Why would your 48 be any different?  Bob Vlaisavljevich: ( 46:23 ) President trump won’t back down to anybody. He delivered the best economy in our history and he will do it again for all of us. The Iron Range’s economic future and survival is at stake and so is America’s. We know we can count on president Trump to fight for us and win. Let’s make sure he wins on November 3rd. God bless America.  Abby Johnson: ( 46:52 ) My name is Abby Johnson, and I spent eight years working for Planned Parenthood, but today I’m a pro-life activist. When I was in college, Planned Parenthood approached me at a volunteer fair. They talked about helping women in crisis and their commitment to keep abortion safe, legal, and rare. I was convinced to volunteer and later offered a full-time job as a medical assistant before my promotion to director of the clinic, I truly believed I was helping women, but things drastically changed in 2009. In April, I was awarded Planned Parenthood’s employee of the year award and invited to their annual gala where they present the Margaret Sanger Award named for their founder. And Margaret Sanger was a racist who believed in eugenics. Her goal when founding Planned Parenthood was to eradicate the minority population. Today, almost 80% of Planned Parenthood abortion facilities are strategically located in minority neighborhoods. And every year Planned Parenthood celebrates its racist roots by presenting the Margaret Sanger award.  Abby Johnson: ( 48:08 ) Later in August, my supervisor assigned me a new quota to meet, an abortion quota. I was expected to sell double the abortions performed the previous year. When I pushed back, underscoring Planned Parenthood’s public facing goal of decreasing abortions, I was reprimanded and told, abortion is how we make our money. But the tipping point came a month later when a physician asked me to assist with an ultrasound-guided abortion. Nothing prepared me for what I saw on the screen, an unborn baby fighting back, desperate to move away from the suction. And I’ll never forget what the doctor said next, “Beam me up Scotty.” The last thing I saw was a spine twirling around in the mother’s womb before succumbing to the force of the suction. On October sixth, I left the clinic looking back only to remember why I now advocate so passionately for life. I founded and currently run And Then There Were None, a non-profit organization that’s helped nearly 600 abortion workers transition out of the industry. For most people who consider themselves pro-life, abortion is abstract. They can’t even conceive of the barbarity. They don’t know about the products of conception room and abortion clinics where infant corpses are pieced back together to ensure nothing remains in the mother’s wombs, or that we joked and called it the pieces of children room. You see, for me, abortion is real. I know what it sounds like. I know what abortion smells like. Did you know abortion even had a smell? I’ve been the perpetrator to these babies, to these women, and I now support president Trump because he has done more for the unborn than any other president. During his first month in office, he banned federal funds for global health groups that promote abortion. That same year, he overturned an Obama-Biden rule that allowed government subsidy of abortion. He appointed a record number of pro-life judges, including two Supreme Court justices. And importantly, he announced a new rule protecting the rights of healthcare workers objecting to abortion, many of whom I work with every day.  Abby Johnson: ( 50:48 ) Life is a core tenet of who we are as Americans. And this election is a choice between two radical anti-life activists and the most pro-life president we have ever had. That’s something that should compel you to action. Go door to door, make calls, talk to your neighbors and friends, and vote on November 3rd. Take action that reelects our president, and do it with our very most vulnerable Americans in mind, the ones who haven’t been born yet.  Speaker 30: ( 51:33 ) It began as a class trip to join thousands for the annual March for Life. These Catholic young men traveled from Kentucky to stand up for what they believed in, but what happened was something very different.  Speaker 31: ( 51:47 ) Crackers with a Make America Great hat on! You little dirty (beep) crackers, your day coming. Young Klansmen.  Speaker 32: ( 51:53 ) Look at that Make America Great Again hat!  Speaker 30: ( 52:07 ) Social media, the news, and even celebrities launched a campaign of persecution that was completely false against a boy in a Make America Great Again hat.  Speaker 33: ( 52:08 ) The MAGA hat carries a certain connotation that provokes a conditioned reaction.  Speaker 34: ( 52:13 ) I blame that (beep) kid. What a load of crap.  Trevor Noah: ( 52:16 ) Everyone that sees that smug look wants to punch that kid.  Speaker 30: ( 52:17 ) Nicholas Sandmann received death threats, and his school was forced to close. Tonight, Nicholas tells his story.  Nicholas Sandmann: ( 52:30 ) Good evening everyone. My name is Nick Sandmann and I’m the teenager who was defamed by the media after an encounter with a group of protesters on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial last year. Before I begin, I’d like to thank president Trump for the opportunity to share some of my story and why it matters so much to this November’s election. In 2019, I attended the March for Life in Washington DC, where I demonstrated in defense of unborn. Later that day, I bought a Make America Great Again hat because our president Donald Trump has distinguished himself as one of the most pro-life presidents in the history of our country, and I wanted to express my support for him too. Looking back now, how could I have possibly imagined that the simple act of putting on that red hat would unleash hate from the left and make myself the target of network and cable news networks nationwide? Being from Kentucky, the birthplace of Abraham Lincoln, my classmates and I visited the Lincoln Memorial.  Nicholas Sandmann: ( 53:36 ) I found myself face to face with Nathan Phillips and other professional protestors looking to turn me into the latest poster child showing why Trump is bad. While the media portrayed me as an aggressor with a relentless smirk on my face, in reality, the video confirms I was standing with my hands behind my back, and an awkward smile on my face that had two thoughts. One, don’t do anything that might further agitate the man banging a drum in my face. And two, I was trying to follow a family friend’s advice, never to do anything to embarrass your family, your school, or your community. Before I knew what was happening, it was over. One of Mr. Phillips’ fellow agitators yelled out, “We got him. It’s all right here on video, and we won grandpa.” What I thought was a strange encounter, quickly developed into a major news story complete with video footage.  Nicholas Sandmann: ( 54:37 ) My life changed forever in that one moment. The full war machine of the mainstream media revved up into attack mode. They did so without researching the full video of the incident, without ever investigating Mr. Phillips’ motives, or without ever asking me for my side of the story. And do you know why? Because the truth was not important. Advancing their anti-Christian, anti-conservative, anti-Donald Trump narrative was all that mattered. And if advancing their narrative ruined the reputation and future of a teenager from Covington, Kentucky, well, so be it. That would teach him not to wear a MAGA hat. I learned what was happening to me had a name. It was called being canceled, as in annulled, as in revoked, as in made void. Canceled is what’s happening to people around this country who refuse to be silenced by the far left. Many are being fired, humiliated, or even threatened. And often the media is a willing participant, but I would not be canceled. I fought back hard to expose the media for what they did to me, and I won a personal victory.  Nicholas Sandmann: ( 55:53 ) While much more must be done. I look forward to the day that the media returns to providing balanced, responsible, and accountable news coverage. I know president Trump hopes for that too. And I know you all agree with me when we say that no one in this country has been a victim of unfair media coverage more than president Donald Trump. In November, I believe this country must unite around a president who calls the media out and refuses to allow them to create a narrative instead of reporting the facts. I believe we must join a president who will challenge the media to return to objective journalism. And together, I believe we must all embrace our First Amendment rights and not hide in fear of the media, or from the tech companies, or from the outrage mob either. This is worth fighting for, this is worth voting for, and this is what Donald Trump stands for. Thank you all for listening to me tonight. And one more thing, let’s Make America Great Again.  Pam Bondi: ( 57:15 ) I’m Pam Bondi. Our party’s theme tonight is America, the land of opportunity. And listening to the stories of discoveries and deliverance, you can’t help but be proud to call this country home. But for Joe Biden, it’s been the land of opportunism, not opportunity. As a career prosecutor and former Attorney General of Florida, I fought corruption, and I know what it looks like, whether it’s done by people wearing pinstripe suits or orange jumpsuits. At the Democrats Convention, we were told to look at Joe Biden as the model of integrity. But when you look at his 47 year career in politics, the people who benefited are his family members, not the American people. Let’s take a closer look.  Pam Bondi: ( 58:05 ) We all know about Joe’s son, Hunter Biden. A corrupt Ukrainian oligarch put Hunter on the board of his gas company, even though he had no experience in Ukraine or in the energy sector, none. Yet he was paid millions to do nothing. He only had one qualification that mattered. He was the son of the man in charge of distributing US aid to Ukraine, and recently reported information revealed that a few months after Hunter Biden joined that corrupt company’s board, the Obama-Biden State Department began doing business with him, even when it remained under investigation for corruption. And it gets worse. That very same company was being investigated by a Ukrainian prosecutor. Joe Biden, the vice president of the United States threatened to withhold aid to Ukraine unless that same prosecutor was fired, and then he was fired. Hunter only resigned from that board just before his dad announced his campaign for president.  Pam Bondi: ( 59:18 ) Now let’s talk about China. Fact, Joe Biden flew to China on Air Force Two with Hunter along for the ride. They said he was just there as a family member, but we know that’s untrue. In Beijing. Hunter didn’t just go sightseeing. He had meetings with his Chinese bank partners. Hunter even arranged for his dad to meet with one of the partners. 10 days later, those Chinese communist bankers approved millions to go to Hunter’s firm, and those bankers work for the Chinese Communist Party, which oppresses their people, cheated American workers for decades, and covered up a deadly virus. To this day, Hunter controls a 10% stake in that firm, and Joe Biden’s done more than look the other way on China. He said, “The Chinese aren’t our competition. Come on man. They’re not bad folks.” Come on Joe. Talk to the folks in middle America who lost countless jobs to China while your son was getting rich with them. But there’s more. Fact, there’ve been numerous press reports that have shown other close Biden family members benefited from Joe’s 47 year political career.  Pam Bondi: ( 01:00:39 ) Joe Biden was point person on Iraq. The president of a construction firm met with Biden’s team in the White House and then, who did they hire to build thousands of houses in Iraq? Joe Biden’s close family member, who you guessed it, had no experience in the industry and no experience in Iraq. A company official bragged that it helps to have a family member of the vice president as partner. The family member put it more bluntly by saying, “There’s a line of 747s, filled with cash, ready to invest.” Now let’s follow the money down south. Again, as reported in the press, yet another close family member of Joe’s, set his sights on Costa Rica and Jamaica where millions of dollars flowed from the Obama-Biden administration in taxpayer back loans to projects linked to, yes, that same family member. These aren’t isolated incidents. It is a deliberate pattern of conduct. And that’s just what he did as vice-president. Imagine what he’d do as president.  Pam Bondi: ( 01:01:54 ) How many American families would be allowed to get away with this? Why should there be one standard for the elite political class and another set of rules for the rest of us? When millions of Americans voted for Donald Trump, they knew he’d be different, and he is. He’s a tough, no nonsense outsider who can’t be bought or intimidated. He won’t even take a paycheck from the American people. He donates his paycheck to charities across this country. Democrats have been lecturing America about integrity for four years while their nominee has been writing the textbook on abusive power for 40 years. If they want to make this election a choice between who’s saving America and who’s swindling America, bring it on. Joe says he’ll build back better. Yeah, build the Bidens back better. Our president is in this to build a safer, better, and stronger America, and he will finish what he started to keep this a real land of opportunity for everyone. If you want to check your voting status, secure your ballot, or registered to vote, text vote to 88022. Remember, the best is yet to come.  Donald Trump: ( 01:03:46 ) Women have played a very, very big role. The level of genius is unbelievable frankly.  Speaker 35: ( 01:03:53 ) You’re what? You’ve got 70, 80 years on this earth. What are you going to do with it? Are you going to make that difference are going to say, “I was there for the big battles in our country to save America?”  Mercdes Schlapp: ( 01:04:04 ) It’s what I feel very much called to do, ever since I was a very young girl.  Speaker 36: ( 01:04:09 ) In 2016, Donald Trump made his historic run for the office of United States president. Knowing the monumental task he would be undertaking, he rested all of his hopes for winning on one woman. Because of that trust, he became a 45th president of the United States and Kellyanne Conway became the first woman in US history to manage a winning presidential campaign.  Kellyanne Conway: ( 01:04:32 ) This president has been a champion for women mostly because he speaks to them as if they can handle and tackle all the issues.  Kimberly Guilfoyle: ( 01:04:42 ) I don’t want a job because of my gender. I want the job because I’m the best person for that position. That’s it. And he respects that and he appreciates hard work. You can’t ask for anything better especially in a boss.  Speaker 36: ( 01:04:59 ) President Trump continues to place strong women into significant positions throughout his administration and campaign, far more than any other president in US history.  Brooke Rollins: ( 01:05:09 ) That he has had, and does have more women on his top team than any president before, but it actually goes down to his deputy assistants, to his special assistance, to our awesome teams throughout the West Wing.  Katrina Pierson: ( 01:05:21 ) And when he called me and said, “I want you to represent my entire campaign,” I became the first black woman to represent a Republican presidential campaign, winning presidential campaign in United States history.  Speaker 36: ( 01:05:36 ) Throughout his career, Trump has always touted family first as a core value. He shows this especially with his choices of press secretaries, choosing Sarah Sanders, the first mother to become a press secretary, Stephanie Grisham, the first single mother to serve as press secretary, and Kayleigh McEnany, who transitioned into the job while also transitioning into the job of mum.  Brooke Rollins: ( 01:05:58 ) I have four children, Kellyanne Conway has four children. Ivanka has three. I think, between all the senior staff women, we-  Speaker 37: ( 01:06:03 ) Conway has four children, Ivanka has … I think between all the senior staff women, we might have 75 kids. I’m not sure, we’ve lost count but the importance of the work is never lost on any of us and truly it is those children that we are fighting for and for their future.  Speaker 38: ( 01:06:16 ) With these capable women placed in positions of power influence and authority, President Trump has proven that when the stakes are highest, he is proud to entrust many of our nation’s most crucial jobs to women.  Speaker 37: ( 01:06:28 ) The number of dedicated, amazing, brilliant, relentless women that are dedicated to the country and to the president and to preserving the American dream is one of the greatest if not the greatest things I’ll ever be a part of.  Ronna McDaniel: ( 01:06:49 ) Only the president would say, “Let’s take that stay at home mom and have her run the party.” What a smart guy.  Tiffany Trump: ( 01:07:01 ) Good evening. I’m Tiffany Trump. Since speaking at the Republican convention four years ago, so much has changed for the world, for our country, and for my family. Like so many students across the world, I graduated from law school during the pandemic. Our generation is unified in facing the future in uncertain times, and many of us are considering what kind of country we want to live in.  Tiffany Trump: ( 01:07:29 ) As a recent graduate, I can relate to so many of you who might be looking for a job. My father built a thriving economy once and believe me, he will do it again. This election, I urge each and every one of you, to transcend political boundaries. This is a fight for freedom versus oppression, for opportunity versus stagnation. A fight to keep America true to America. I urge you to make judgment based on results and not rhetoric. If you believe in criminal justice reform, there is only one president that passed the First Step Act, giving people a second chance, a chance at a life once again and if you believe in expanding quality and affordable healthcare, only President Trump, my father signed the right to try into law the favored nations clause and other actions to lower drug prices and keep Americans from getting ripped off.  Tiffany Trump: ( 01:08:34 ) People must recognize that our thoughts, our opinions, and even the choice of who we are voting for may and are being manipulated and visibly coerced by the media and tech giants. If you tune into the media, you get one biased opinion or another, and what you share, if it does not fit into the narrative that they seek to promote, then it is either ignored or deemed a lie, regardless of the truth. This manipulation of what information we receive impedes our freedoms, rather than allowing Americans the right to form our own beliefs, this misinformation system keeps people mentally enslaved to the ideas they deem correct. This has fostered unnecessary fear and divisiveness amongst us. Why are so many in media and technology and even in our own government so invested in promoting a biased and fabricated view? Ask yourselves, why are we prevented from seeing certain information? Why is one viewpoint promoted while others are hidden? The answer is control, because division and controversy breed profit.  Tiffany Trump: ( 01:09:52 ) But what are the consequences when only one side of the story gets out or when only one viewpoint is acceptable? For our education system, it meant sacrificing civil debate by creating an atmosphere where students with contrary opinions are too afraid to speak. Many students find themselves suppressing their beliefs to fit into what the acceptable groupthink is. In short, our nation suffers by inhibiting our diversity of thought and inclusion of ideas. Working together outside of our political comfort zones, we’ll accomplish so much more. Some cynical politicians do not seem to believe in the miracle of America. Well I do. As Maximo Alvarez said so eloquently last night, “If freedom is lost in this country, there is nowhere else to go.” Having hope is not weakness and believing in miracles is a gift from God.  Tiffany Trump: ( 01:10:55 ) So tonight, I want to tell you the uncensored truth of what we believe in. We believe in equality of opportunity. We believe in freedom of thought and expression. Think what you want, seek out the truth, learn from those with different opinions, and then freely make your voice heard to the world. We believe in school choice because a child’s zip code in America should not determine their future. We believe in freedom of religion for all faiths and we believe in the American spirit, a country founded on ideas, not identity. A country where our differences are embraced and the only country where the word dream has been attached to it. Because in America, your life is yours to chart, so if you’re hearing these things and thinking to yourself, “That is the kind of country that I want to live in,” well, whether you realize it or not, you are a Trump supporter. I encourage you to see beyond the façade that so many other politicians employ. They mask themselves in disguises of decency as they try to pressure us to mask our own identities and beliefs.  Tiffany Trump: ( 01:12:12 ) My father is the only person to challenge the establishment, the entrenched bureaucracy, big pharma and media monopolies, to ensure that Americans’ constitutional freedoms are upheld and that justice and truth prevail. My father does not run away from challenges, even in the face of outright hatred, because fighting for America is something he will sacrifice anything for. He dreams big dreams for our country and he is relentless at achieving them. You see, Make America Great Again is not a slogan for my father. It is what drives him to keep his promise of doing what is right for American citizens.  Tiffany Trump: ( 01:12:57 ) The energy of change and opportunity is with us. God has blessed us with unstoppable spirit. His spirit, the American spirit, my dad has proven to be driven by that spirit. He has demonstrated his faith and his uncompromising heart and actions. My father has made me believe that America can truly be great again. If you care about living your life without restraints, about rebelling against those who would suppress your voice and building your American dream, then the choice in this election is clear. A vote for my father, Donald J. Trump, is a vote to uphold our American ideals. Be true to yourself and stay true to the dream of America. Thank you and God bless you all.  Kim Reynolds: ( 01:13:54 ) I’m Kim Reynolds, governor of the great state of Iowa. I love this state and I’m so proud to serve its people. Iowa truly is a land of opportunity. It’s the birthplace of the computer, it’s a landmark of the financial services industry, and as so many of you already know, it’s filled with farmland that feeds and fuels the world. It’s also home to people who care for one another, who work hard, who love this country, and are truly grateful for the freedoms it provides. As I like to say, Iowa is one big small town, neighbor helping neighbor is in our DNA. From the sick farmer who can’t harvest his crops to the single mom who loses her job and is struggling to get back on her feet, the town, the community helps them get through it. But what happens when a storm rips through almost the entire state? When it’s not one farmer who lost his crop, but hundreds? When it’s not one neighbor who is without food, but thousands? That happened just two weeks ago. A storm called a derecho with hurricane force winds of up to 140 miles per hour, wiped out millions of acres of crops, left thousands without power. It destroyed homes, wrecked lives, and left devastation in its wake. It was the worst storm in our state’s history and Iowans did what you expect Iowans to do. They helped each other, they took care of each other, and they still are.  Kim Reynolds: ( 01:15:29 ) But someone else had our back, our president. When the winds had finished raging and the cleanup had only begun, he showed up. Now you might not know that because the national media didn’t report it, but the Trump administration was here in full force. The day after the storm, the president called to assure me that we have the full backing of the federal government and later that week, Vice President Pence came to Iowa to again assure us that the president and his administration were behind us. With the help of the Trump administration, we quickly received a major disaster declaration that will help Iowans get back on their feet. The president, he cut through the bureaucracy to do what needed to be done and to do it quickly.  Kim Reynolds: ( 01:16:18 ) But that’s not the first time President Trump showed Iowans that we can rely on him. In 2019, when 100 year floods breached nearly every levy and devastated communities large and small along the Missouri River in Iowa, Nebraska and Missouri, the president approved our request for aid in record time, in just two days. Well this year, he did it in less than 24 hours. So whether it’s providing needed relief to farmers who were the target of China’s unfair trade practices, hammering out new free and fair trade deals, or fighting for workers and small businesses who were hit hard by COVID-19, we have a president and a vice president who get things done and because of President Trump and his leadership, our country is able to bounce back from setbacks and see opportunity grow and thrive.  Kim Reynolds: ( 01:17:17 ) This is an administration of action and outcomes. They are delivering every day on their promise to Make America Great Again, and that’s exactly why we need to re-elect President Donald J. Trump in November. Thank you, and may God bless the United States of America.  Mike Pence: ( 01:17:41 ) America. The land of opportunity. The country where your own resolution to succeed is more important than any other. Abraham Lincoln’s words from 165 years ago still resonate today because of who we are and because of what we are. A country where a boy born into poverty in a log cabin, raised right here on the frontier of Indiana, could educate himself, become a lawyer, become a president of the United States who would preserve the union, abolish slavery, and save the nation. As a fellow Hoosier, visiting Lincoln’s boyhood home has always been a treasured experience for me and my family. It’s a place that made Lincoln, it shaped Lincoln, and defined the man that Lincoln would become. America is the land of opportunity. As President Donald Trump declared at Mount Rushmore, in America you can do anything, you can be anything, and together, we can achieve anything.  Mike Pence: ( 01:18:51 ) Every day, President Donald Trump is fighting to protect the promise of American liberty. Every day, our president has been fighting to expand the reach of the American dream, and on every single day, without fail, President Donald Trump has been fighting for you. So tonight, I’d like to introduce you to a few remarkable Americans who represent that solemn pledge. Who embody our president’s unbreakable devotion to ensuring that America is the land of unlimited opportunity for all.  Mike Pence: ( 01:19:26 ) Jack is an eight-year-old from Wisconsin who was struggling academically and socially in school. Jack’s mom Sarah, who works three jobs to support her son, applied for Wisconsin’s school choice voucher program.  Sarah Hughes: ( 01:19:40 ) We’re glad that we were able to get the school choice voucher to go to that school. With Jack, he would have slipped through the cracks in public schools and having the option to go to a school that fits him has been a real game changer for us and I know that because of that opportunity that he is going to succeed and he is going to achieve that goal of being an apparatus engineer if that’s what he chooses to stick with.  Mike Pence: ( 01:20:10 ) Laura McLinn is a mother of another inspiring boy, Jordan. Jordan has Duchenne muscular dystrophy, a fatal muscle weakening disorder. Jordan was at my side in Indiana when as governor, I signed a law allowing terminally ill patients to access experimental drugs not yet approved by the FDA. In 2018, President Trump signed the landmark Federal Right to Try bill into law. Thanks to the president’s leadership, critically ill patients have the right to access life-saving experimental treatments.  Laura McLinn: ( 01:20:44 ) We started fighting for right to try which basically says if you have a terminal illness and there is a drug that exists and you don’t qualify for the clinical trial, there is no other way to receive it, this is a unique pathway that allows you to have access. You made us a promise back in Indiana that you would do whatever it took to help Jordan and we’re so grateful that you joined us on this journey and stuck it out until it became law so that other people could access treatments.  Mike Pence: ( 01:21:12 ) So Jordan, if President Trump was standing right there, what would you say to him today about right to try?  Jordan McLinn: ( 01:21:18 ) Thank you for being a hero to everybody in the country.  Mike Pence: ( 01:21:25 ) Judge Cheryl Allen made history in 2007 when she became the first African-American woman to be elected to serve on the Pennsylvania Superior Court. It’s because of leaders like Judge Allen that our nation has overcome our greatest challenges.  Mike Pence: ( 01:21:42 ) In this time of racial division in the country –  Cheryl Allen: ( 01:21:46 ) Yes.  Mike Pence: ( 01:21:47 ) Do you see faith and values and –  Cheryl Allen: ( 01:21:50 ) Absolutely.  Mike Pence: ( 01:21:50 ) The strong stand that President Trump has taken for equality of opportunity as a pathway toward bringing the country together?  Cheryl Allen: ( 01:21:58 ) As a senior citizen, I’ll leave it at that, I know what racism feels like, but I also know that but for my being in this country, I would have never been able to achieve the things that I have been able to achieve. There are injustices but the way to deal with those injustices is for people to sit down across the table and talk and come up with solutions. I do believe that President Trump is committed to that. In 2016 I have to confess that I really did not know candidate Trump at the time but I have to say that he really won me over.  Mike Pence: ( 01:22:43 ) Gino is a truck driver from Ohio who heard politicians for years make empty promises about defending American jobs, only to see those promises broken again and again. But in 2019, when General Motors closed its plant in Lordstown, Ohio, President Donald Trump refused to stand by and watch it happen, and as Gino observed, this president reached out to General Motors to find a way to bring jobs back to Lordstown and plans were soon set into motion to create Lordstown Motors.  Gino: ( 01:23:17 ) President Trump says, “This is how we fix it,” and I thought, “Well that’s a simple solution.” There’s no other president that could have done it, there’s no one that has even tried to do it. President Trump is a doer, he appreciates every one of us and I know he does. I’ve seen it. When he said Make America Great Again, that was his task. That wasn’t his slogan, that was his task, and every hat you see that says MAGA on it, that’s what your president is doing for you. Thank you Mr. President for keeping the promises that you made.  Mike Pence: ( 01:23:45 ) And then there’s Pastor Aaron Johnson. Today he’s the executive director of the Tulsa Dream Center, a non-profit that provides education and medical services and food to those in need.  Mike Pence: ( 01:23:56 ) A.J., you’ve got a great personal story when you see the way this president, this administration have been leaning in to create opportunities, investments in communities around the country to create jobs, expanding educational choice. What does that mean to the families that you serve every day?  Aaron Johnson: ( 01:24:13 ) It means so much to our families. I did grow up in a single parent home and so we serve over 600 boys and girls right now on a daily basis even in COVID and so for us, to give these moms to have an opportunity to take more money on their check, on their paycheck home back to them, to have their children to be able to go to a school that they may not have the opportunity to otherwise, it means so much to us. There’s been so much greater opportunity for individuals to come together in any walk of life. People have really been able to see such a positive change and been filled with hope, especially throughout this time.  Mike Pence: ( 01:24:46 ) Lydia left hearth and home, friends and family in Honduras to pursue a better life here in America. While raising their four daughters, Lydia and her husband run a small business that creates security systems but just months after their business was up and running, our nation was struck by a global pandemic. That’s when President Donald Trump stepped in and enacted the largest financial relief package in American history. Her small business stayed in business and her American dream kept running strong.  Mike Pence: ( 01:25:17 ) What did the Paycheck Protection Program mean to your company as the coronavirus struck?  Lydia: ( 01:25:23 ) Yeah. It was a huge, tremendous help and a big blessing and so we applied, we were accepted really quickly. We’re so grateful, you can’t believe how much relief we had. We want to continue serving our clients, we want to continue growing our economy, we want to all continue to move forward. So we were able to make it, because of the support of family and friends, the government. I tell my children, they are born here in the U.S., and I tell them, “You are so blessed to live in America.”  Mike Pence: ( 01:26:07 ) Here at Abraham Lincoln’s boyhood home, a young man would grow up to become the first Republican President of the United States, and today, another Republican president is fighting to preserve that same noble legacy of freedom and President Donald Trump will make certain that the torch of American opportunity illuminates every city, every town, and every community in this blessed land.  Ryan Holets: ( 01:26:34 ) Hi, I’m Ryan Holets, I’m a police officer from New Mexico. In 2017, I had an encounter that changed my life forever. I had just started my shift and responded to a call for service at a gas station. When I arrived, I saw a man and a woman sitting on a grassy slope. I recognized the telltale signs, a needle, a spoon. I knew immediately that they were preparing to inject themselves with heroin. Sadly this is a common sight for me. I encounter the ravages of addiction every day but nothing could prepare me for what I discovered as I approached them. The woman was very pregnant. In my shock, I asked her if she knew that she was harming her baby by doing drugs. She crumbled and burst into tears. Two worlds collided as I knelt down beside her, a police officer and a homeless drug addict, brought together by forces outside of our control.  Ryan Holets: ( 01:27:35 ) As we talked, our humanity, distinct from our stations in life, was made abundantly clear. Her name was Crystal and in the midst of her suffering, she confided that she loved her unborn baby. She wanted the best for her child. In that moment, I saw her the way that all of you who know and love an addict see them, as fathers, mothers, brothers, sisters, children, cousins, and friends, as human beings full of value and dignity but robbed of their potential by this disease. When Crystal said that she was looking for a family to adopt her baby, God showed me exactly what I had to do. Without hesitation, I told her that my family would welcome her baby through adoption.  Ryan Holets: ( 01:28:26 ) Today, our beautiful daughter Hope is a thriving two-year- old. Crystal is fast approaching three years of recovery. She is a dear friend and a constant inspiration to me and others. I hold a special place in my heart for those facing opioid addiction and that’s why I’m enormously grateful to the president for his leadership in fighting this deadly enemy. Through his efforts, we’re turning the tide on the crisis of addiction. President Trump declared the opioid crisis to be a public health emergency and then secured $6 billion in new federal funding to help Americans fight opioid abuse. He invested an additional $100 million to stop the opioid crisis in rural America and in a move that strikes at the root of the problem, he implemented a safer prescribing plan aimed at reducing opioid prescriptions by over a third within three years.  Ryan Holets: ( 01:29:24 ) This is an effort that stops addiction before it ever gains ahold in someone’s life and it’s having an impact. Drug overdose deaths decreased in 2018 for the first time in 30 years. Many of the states hardest hit by the opioid crisis are seeing the largest drop in deaths. We’re seeing that doctors are writing fewer prescriptions for opioid pain drugs. These are significant improvements that have a meaningful impact.  Ryan Holets: ( 01:29:57 ) I think we are fortunate, America, to have a president who cares deeply for the downtrodden and who works tirelessly to find solutions. A president who doesn’t just talk about problems but stops and helps. President Trump is the leader we’ve needed the last four years and he is the leader we need for the next four. You see, Donald Trump is the right president at the right time. Let’s make sure he’s re-elected on November 3. I pray God’s blessings on you and your family and may God bless America.  Jeanette Nunez: ( 01:30:39 ) Good evening. My name is Jeanette Nunez and I’m proud to serve as lieutenant governor of the great state of Florida. Tonight, I’m honored to share my story of faith, family, and American freedom. As the daughter of Cuban immigrants, my story began in 1959 before I was born when my parents’ dreams of a prosperous life became a nightmare. Chaos spread quickly when Fidel Castro took control of Cuba. The government confiscated private property, stealing people’s homes, farms, and businesses. For my parents, the difficult decision to flee communist Cuba came when the Castro regime abolished religious freedom.  Jeanette Nunez: ( 01:31:29 ) Fellow Americans, the fabric of our nation is in peril. Daily, the radical left systematically chisels away at the freedoms we cherish. They peddle dangerous ideologies, cower to global progressives, and normalize socialism to dismantle our constitution. Let me assure you, socialism doesn’t offer opportunity. Socialism deprives. It is a falsehood that feigns promises for its masses and consistently yields only misery. President Ronald Reagan warned, “If we lose freedom here, there’s no place to escape to.”Truer words had never been spoken.  Jeanette Nunez: ( 01:32:14 ) Americans have a choice. We can go down a dark road of chaos and government control, or we can choose a path of freedom and opportunity that was paved by those who sacrificed everything to preserve the American dream for future generations. I have faith that Americans will choose the right path. In 2016, our country yearned for a leader who would work tirelessly to jumpstart our economy and fight for hardworking Americans. Since day one, President Donald Trump has put America first. His pro-growth, pro-jobs agenda has ushered in historically low unemployment, record job creation, higher wages, and rising home ownership. The president is fighting to rescue American jobs and industries for places like Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Puerto Rico. Jobs that were needlessly shipped overseas. He’s defended our religious freedom, stood with democratic allies like Colombia and shown unwavering resolve while confronting tyrants in countries like Venezuela, Cuba, China, and Nicaragua. Let us join our president in his vow that America will never be a socialist country. Supporting our president requires action. Join me tonight and text VOTE to 88022.  Jeanette Nunez: ( 01:33:50 ) We must continue to support our commander in chief who has a bold agenda that safeguards the rights and freedoms protected under our constitution. Today, more than ever, that means supporting our men and women in law enforcement and our heroes in uniform. It means fighting to provide the best quality education, by empowering parents and preserving school choice, and it means rejecting the socialist takeover of our nation that will destroy innovation, economic vitality, and freedoms we hold so dear.  Jeanette Nunez: ( 01:34:27 ) As a daughter of immigrants, a wife, a mother of three and the first Latina lieutenant governor in the history of the state of Florida, it is my distinct privilege to share my story, which is really your story and the story of a nation that has opened its doors, lifted its people, and yielded success in a way only the United States of America can. Together, let’s ensure four more years for President Donald J. Trump so that he can continue protecting our republic and so one day, our children can proudly tell the story of what our generation did to defend the values of faith, family and freedom. Thank you, may God bless each one of you, and may God bless the United States of America.  Speaker 39: ( 01:35:35 ) Ladies and gentlemen, the President of the United States.

Candidates for naturalizaton: ( 01:38:57 ) Thank you Mr. President.

Donald Trump: ( 01:39:20 ) You followed the rules, you obeyed the laws, you learned your history, embraced our values and proved yourselves to be men and women of the highest integrity. It’s not so easy, you went through a lot and we appreciate you being here with us today. You’ve earned the most prized, treasured, cherished and priceless possession anywhere in the world.

At this time, I’d like to recognize the five new citizens who join us today. [Robert Martin Ramirez Alcaser 00:01:03] is from Bolivia and has been a lawful permanent resident of the United States since 2013.  Donald Trump: ( 01:40:14 ) Robert. Hi, Robert. He and his wife are raising three beautiful children. In 2017, Robert achieved the dream of starting his own business, a construction company that now employs five workers. Robert says, “I love this country. I want to respect the law. America has helped me so much in life.” Robert, thank you very much for your devotion.  Robert Ramirez: ( 01:40:40 ) Thank you for the opportunity to the United States.  Donald Trump: ( 01:40:43 ) Thank you, and good luck with that company. Soon you’ll have hundreds of employees, I think. Right?  Robert Ramirez: ( 01:40:48 ) I will.  Donald Trump: ( 01:40:49 ) Could happen. It will. [Remi Gideon 00:01:40:52] is from Lebanon and is the proud mother of three children. [Remi 01:40:57] speaks English, Arabic and French and earned a degree in psychology.

[Remi 01:41:20] congratulations. That’s really great. Thank you.  Donald Trump: ( 01:41:24 ) That’s very good. Thank you very much, I appreciate it. Sudha Sundari Narayanan, is a phenomenal success. Born in India, came to the United States 13 years ago. Sudha is a talented software developer. She and her husband are raising two beautiful, wonderful children. The apples of your life. Right?  Sudha: ( 01:41:54 ) Yes, they are.  Donald Trump: ( 01:41:54 ) Well, thank you very much and congratulations. Fantastic job. Thank you.

Well, [Nemed 01:42:34], thank you very much and congratulations. It’s my honor to be with you.  Donald Trump: ( 01:42:39 ) Thank you. Thank you very much. [Sallah Abdul Samad 00:03:41] has been looking forward to this day since he arrived in the United States from Ghana in 2015. Sally speaks five languages and works the medical field. Sally says that, “The American citizenship means everything to me in my life. It can not be measured or quantified. I have the chance to work hard and succeed in life. To know that I am in the safe country like America, that really is something because I know they have my back.” Sally, thank you very much. Congratulations. Fantastic job. Congratulations to everybody. With the rights and freedoms each of you now enjoy as citizens, there is no dream beyond your wildest reach because Americans can do anything. Today, you have also accepted the profound duties and responsibilities that come with American citizenship. By swearing, the oath of allegiance, each of you has entered a sacred and unbreakable covenant with our nation.  Donald Trump: ( 01:43:49 ) You’ve pledged your undying loyalty to the American people, the American constitution and the American way of life. The history and heritage of the United States are now yours to preserve and pass down to the next generation. Our culture, our traditions and our values are now yours to uphold and live by. The rights so dear to every American granted by us and granted by God and enshrined in our glorious Bill of Rights are now yours to support, protect, and defend. As citizens, you’re now stewards of this magnificent nation, a family comprised of every race, color, religion, and creed. United by the bonds of love, we are one people sharing one home saluting one great American flag. Congratulations again to all of you. May God bless you. And may God bless our great country America.  Eric Trump: ( 01:45:05 ) Good evening America. When I stood on this convention stage four years ago, no one fully understood the historic change that was about to take place. We could all feel it. Something was happening. A movement was forming just below the surface. The forgotten men and women voiceless in Washington D.C, were preparing to rise up. Our movement followed the pattern of so many that came before us. First, we were ignored. Then we were laughed at. Then they fought us and then together we won. From that moment forward, America came first. America started winning again. America became respected again. But with every movement, there’s a counter movement. In the view of the radical Democrats, America is a source of the world’s problems. As a result, they believe the only path forward is to erase history and forget the past. They want to destroy the monuments of our forefathers. They want to disrespect our flag, burn the stars and stripes represent patriotism and the American dream.  Eric Trump: ( 01:46:09 ) They want to disrespect our National Anthem by taking a knee while our armed forces laid down their lives every day to protect our freedom. They do not want the Pledge of Allegiance in our schools. Many of them don’t want one nation under God. The Democrats want to defund and disrespect our law enforcement. The Democrats want an America where your thoughts and opinions are censored when they do not align with their own. President Reagan said, “Freedom is never more than one generation away from extinction. It must be fought for, and it must be protected.” This is a fight that we are in right now, and it is a fight that only my father can win. My father ran not because he needed the job, but because he knew hard working people across this great country were being left behind. The media mocked these patriots in the flyover states, in which they lived.  Eric Trump: ( 01:47:02 ) They ignored the Trump flags. They ignore the millions of MAGA banners and barns painted in red, white, and blue. The silent majority had no one fighting for them in either party. Their so-called leaders are bowing to China, bribing Iran, and spending more time worrying about how they’d be received by the elites in Paris than how Americans would provide for their families in Pittsburgh. Our family lost friends but it only pushed us to fight harder. My father pledged to every American in every city, state, and town that he was going to make America great again. And so began the great American comeback. Almost immediately taxes were slashed, regulations were cut, and the economy soared to new heights, heights never seen before. Wages went through the roof. Unemployment reached historic lows, especially for black Americans, Hispanic Americans and women. Trade deals were ripped up and renegotiated. Lights were turned back on in abandoned factories across our country.  Eric Trump: ( 01:48:03 ) Trillions of dollars were repatriated back to the United States, which had been sitting in foreign lands for far too long. Once again, America became the envy of the world. And with that renewed strength came a leverage. The President demanded that our allies pay their fair share for the defense of a Western world. My father rebuilt the mighty American military, adding new jets, aircraft carriers. He increased wages for our incredible men and women in uniform. He expanded our military defense budget to $721 billion per year. America was no longer weak in the eye of the enemy. The moment President Trump ordered special forces kill some of the deadliest terrorists on planet. The day the mighty MOAB was dropped on insurgent camps is a day America took a stance in never be defeated by the enemy. al-Baghdadi, Soleimani, dead. Over and over, issue after issue, the economy, the wall, the military, trade deals, tax cuts, Supreme Court Justices, VA hospitals, prescription drugs, school choice, Right to Try, moving the embassy to Jerusalem, peace in the Middle East, never-ending wars were finally ended. Promises made and promises for the first time were kept.  Eric Trump: ( 01:49:24 ) Most politicians spend their entire careers in Washington D.C and get absolutely nothing accomplished for example, Joe Biden. Joe Biden is a politician who has been in government for 47 years. He’s a career politician who has never signed the front of a check and does not know the slightest thing about the American worker or the American business, the engine which fuels the greatest economy the world has ever known. The same politician who has been a total pushover for communist China and someone who’d be a giant relief for terrorists who now have spent years running, hiding, and being taken out by the most talented military known to man. Joe Biden has pledged to raise your taxes by $4 trillion. 82% of Americans will see their taxes go up significantly.  Eric Trump: ( 01:50:14 ) Biden has pledged to stop border wall construction and give amnesty and healthcare to all illegal immigrants. Biden has pledge to defund the police and take away your cherished second amendment. My father on the other hand delivered the largest tax cuts in American history, knows if you do not have a border, you do not have heavy country and will always support law enforcement in your right to keep and bear arms. Every day my father fights for the American people, the forgotten men and women of this country, the ones who embody the American spirit, which is unlike anything else in the world. It built the New York city skyline. It built the Hoover Dam. And soon under my father’s leadership, it will send Americans to Mars. The American spirit can be felt in the majesty of the Grand Canyon, the shadows of Mount Rushmore and the stillness of the air at Gettysburg.  Eric Trump: ( 01:51:16 ) It can be seen in the wide eyed wonder of every American child as they take their first breath in the greatest country the world has ever known. It defeated fascism, it defeated communism and in 68 days, it will defeat the empty, oppressive and radical views of the extreme left. Ronald Reagan’s quote ends with this simple warning. “One day we could spend our sunset years telling our children what it was once like in the United States, where men and women were free.” Under President Trump, freedom will never be a thing of the past. That’s what a vote for Donald Trump represents. It’s a vote for the American spirit, the American dream, and for the American flag. To the law enforcement officer, who’s being attacked, betrayed, and whose job they are trying to make extinct, my father will fight for you.  Eric Trump: ( 01:52:15 ) To all houses of worship and to all people of faith stripped of our religious freedoms and religious liberties, my father will fight for you. To the voiceless, shamed, censored, and canceled, my father will fight for you. To our farmers who work dawn to dust to keep our plates full, my father will fight for you. To every single mother and father, to our veterans, our coal miners, and to the American worker, my father will fight for you. And to every proud American who bleeds red, white, and blue, my father will continue to fight for you.  Eric Trump: ( 01:52:57 ) In closing, I’d like to speak directly to my father. I miss working alongside you every single day, but I’m damn proud to be on the front lines of this fight. I’m proud of what you’re doing for this country. I’m proud to show my children what their grandfather is fighting for. I’m proud to watch you give them hell. Never stop. Continue to be unapologetic. Keep fighting for what is right. You are making America strong again. You are making America safe again. You are making America proud again. And yes, together with our forgotten men and women who are finally forgotten no more, you are making America great again. Dad, let’s make Uncle Robert very proud this week. Let’s go get another four years. I love you very much. God bless you. And God bless the United States of America.  Donald Trump: ( 01:54:00 ) We’re going to build a future of safety and opportunity for Americans of every race, color, religion, and creed.  Speaker 41: ( 01:54:17 ) Our president has created such a surplus that when this pandemic hit, he was able to refund Americans without indebting us.  Donald Trump: ( 01:54:24 ) We’re all better off when former inmates can receive and reenter society as law abiding, productive citizens, and now have a chance at more opportunities than they’ve ever had before.  Speaker 42: ( 01:54:37 ) To be incarcerated for 16 and a half years for hearsay. I get emotional talking about it. It’s a feeling that I can’t describe.  Speaker 43: ( 01:54:50 ) When people say, “We’re oppressed here in the United States,” how?  Speaker 44: ( 01:54:57 ) Right now this country for me is the last beacon of hope and opportunity. If America falls, the entire world falls.  Speaker 45: ( 01:55:06 ) Trump’s pledge to the American workers definitely means a lot to me because I wouldn’t be where I’m at today. I truly believe that my kids are going to look up to me one day. It’s just tremendous what I could do, I guess.  Donald Trump: ( 01:55:19 ) The forgotten men and women will never be forgotten again.  Speaker 46: ( 01:55:25 ) You know, in Biden’s America, there aren’t opportunity zones. Here, you have an administration that actually looks at, “How can government and private enterprise work together?”  Donald Trump: ( 01:55:35 ) As we fight to deliver a better future for all women and for all Americans, we remember the wonderful victory one century ago.  Speaker 47: ( 01:55:44 ) And in the coming November, the ladies appeared at the polls on election day by the hundreds of thousands. They had won their right to vote.  Donald Trump: ( 01:55:50 ) Before the China virus set in and struck our nation, women had gained 4.3 million jobs, a record. The women’s unemployment rate had plummeted to the lowest level in more than 65 years. And last year over 70% of the new jobs went to women. And I will say, we’re coming back very strongly.  Speaker 48: ( 01:56:10 ) We have the most opportunity.  Speaker 49: ( 01:56:13 ) I see American stories in that. That we have hope. That even though we’re in dark days now, that the days ahead hold greater possibilities because of the opportunities that we’ve been given in our country.  Donald Trump: ( 01:56:39 ) And we will make American great again.  Daniel Cameron: ( 01:56:48 ) Good evening. My name is Daniel Cameron. I’m 34 years old and the first African American Attorney General in Kentucky history. It is an honor to be with you as a proud Republican and supporter of Donald J. Trump. I was raised in Kentucky, just a few miles from Abraham Lincoln’s birthplace. Our first Republican president believed in compassion, self-reliance, freedom, equality, and justice. Sadly, there are some who don’t believe in this wisdom or in the better angels of our shared American history, as they tear down the statues of people like Ulysses S. Grant, Frederick Douglass and even Mr. Lincoln himself. Lincoln said, “Any nation that does not honor its heroes will not long endure.” And for Republicans, our heroes are those who propelled an imperfect nation ever forward, always striving to make life better for everyone. Even as anarchists mindlessly tear up American cities while attacking police and innocent bystanders, we Republicans do recognize those who work in good faith towards peace, justice, and equality.  Daniel Cameron: ( 01:58:07 ) In fact, it was General Dwight Eisenhower, a future Republican president, who said, “Democracy is a system that recognizes the equality of humans before the law.” Whether you are the family of Breonna Taylor or David Dorn, these are the ideals that will heal our nation’s wounds. Republicans will never turn a blind eye to unjust acts, but neither will we accept an all-out assault on Western Civilization. My values were shaped by my faith and by my parents. I worked at their small coffee shop, meeting people from all walks of life. And I realized something, no matter who we are, everyone needs a cup of coffee. That lesson stuck with me because despite our differences, we all want the same things: for our children to have more opportunities than we did; to feel the dignity of work; and to believe that if you play by the rules, you can make a good life for yourself and your family.  Daniel Cameron: ( 01:59:14 ) So the question is, will we choose the path that gives us the best chance to meet those universal desires? Or will we go back to a time when people were treated like political commodities, who can’t be trusted to think for themselves? I think often about my ancestors who struggled for freedom. And as I think of those giants and their broad shoulders, I also think about Joe Biden, who says, “If you aren’t voting for me, you ain’t black.” Who argued that Republicans would put us “back in chains.” Who says there is no diversity of thought in the black community. Mr. Vice President, look at me. I am black. We are not all the same, sir. I am not in chains. My mind is my own. And you can’t tell me how to vote because of the color of my skin. Joe Biden is a backwards thinker in a world that is craving forward-looking leadership.  Daniel Cameron: ( 02:00:15 ) There’s no wisdom in his record or plan, just a trail of discredited ideas and offensive statements. Joe Biden would destroy jobs, raise our taxes and throw away the lives of countless unborn children. And he is captive to the radical left, a movement committed to cancel culture and the destruction of public discourse. They believe your skin color must dictate your politics. And if you fail to conform while exercising your God given right to speak and think freely, they will cut you down. The politics of identity, cancellation and mob rule are not acceptable to me. Republicans trust you to think for yourself and to pursue your American dream however you see fit. Mr. Lincoln said, “the dogmas of the quiet past are inadequate to the stormy present. The occasion is piled high with difficulty, and we must rise to the occasion.” I believe Donald Trump can meet Lincoln’s mandate, even as Joe Biden remains trapped by his own failed record, and by the radicals who dominate his party.  Daniel Cameron: ( 02:01:29 ) Let’s be honest. No one is excited about Joe Biden. And so I ask you to judge the record. On criminal justice reform, Joe Biden couldn’t do it, but President Trump did. On the economy, Joe Biden couldn’t do it, but President Trump did build an economy that worked for everyone, especially minorities, and he will do it again. And on immigration, Joe Biden promises more to illegal immigrants than he does to you. But President Trump believes his highest duty is to the American worker. The choice is clear. Let me close with something my mom told me, this country’s many faces comprise a family, not separate parts to be divided against each other. And like any family, we care for one another. We grieve together. We share our burdens and our struggles and we celebrate our successes. And though we fuss and fight, we are not enemies. We are Americans, united by a collective faith in our Constitution and laws and the fundamental fairness they represent.  Daniel Cameron: ( 02:02:40 ) We are defenders of life and of individual liberty. And we carry the mantle of Eisenhower and of Reagan to be a force for good in this world, and one that must always be reckoned with. That’s my Republican Party, the party of Lincoln that believes America is an indispensable nation, an Evergreen Tree standing tall in a turbulent world. And that’s why I am voting for Donald Trump for president. Thank you, and God bless.  Speaker 42: ( 02:03:18 ) Hi, I’m Mike Pompeo. I’m speaking to you from beautiful Jerusalem, looking out over the old city. I have a big job. As Susan’s husband and Nick’s dad, Susan and Nick are more safe and their freedoms more secure because President Trump has put his America first vision into action. It may not have made him popular in every foreign capital, but it’s worked. President Trump understands what my great fellow Kansan, President Eisenhower said, “For all that we cherish and justly desire for ourselves or for our children, the securing of peace is the first requisite.” Indeed, the primary constitutional function of the national government is ensuring that your family and mine are safe and enjoy the freedom to live, to work, to learn and to worship as they choose. Delivering on this duty to keep us safe and our freedoms intact, this president has led bold initiatives in nearly every corner of the world. In China, he’s pulled back the curtain on the predatory aggression of the Chinese Communist Party.  Speaker 42: ( 02:04:23 ) The president has held China accountable for covering up the China virus and allowing it to spread death and economic destruction in America and around the world, and he will not rest until justice is done. He has ensured that the Chinese Communist Party spies posing as diplomats in America are jailed or sent back to China. And he has ended the ridiculously unfair trade arrangement with China that punched a hole in our economy. Those jobs, those jobs are coming back home. In North Korea, the president lowered the temperature and against all odds got the North Korean leadership to the table. No nuclear tests, no long range missile tests and Americans held captive in North Korea came home to their families, as did the precious remains of scores of heroes who fought in Korea. Today, today because of President Trump, NATO is stronger, Ukraine has defensive weapons systems, and America left a harmful treaty so our nation can now build missiles to deter Russian aggression.  Speaker 42: ( 02:05:23 ) And in the Middle East, when Iran threatened the president approved a strike that killed the Iranian terrorist Qasem Soleimani. This is the man most responsible for the murder and maiming of hundreds of American soldiers and thousands of Christians across the Middle East, and you’ll recall too, that when the president took office, radical terrorists had headed Americans and ISIS controlled a territory the size of Great Britain. Today, today because of the president’s determination and leadership, the ISIS caliphate is wiped out, it’s gone. It’s evil leader, Abu Bakar al-Baghdadi, is dead, and our brave soldiers, they’re on their way home. The president exited the U.S from the disastrous nuclear deal with Iran and squeezed the Ayatollah, Hezbollah and Hamas. The president too moved the U.S. embassy to this very city of God, Jerusalem, the rightful capital of the Jewish homeland, and just two weeks ago, the president brokered a historic peace deal between Israel and the United Arab Emirates. This is a deal that our grandchildren will read about in their history books. You know, as a soldier, I saw firsthand people desperate to flee to freedom, the way each of us can best ensure our freedoms is by electing leaders who don’t just talk, but who deliver. An American hostage, imprisoned in Turkey for two years, Pastor Andrew Brunson, said upon his release that he survived his ordeal with these words of scripture, “Be faithful, endure and finish well.” If we stay the course, we will. May God richly bless you and may God bless our great nation, the United States of America.  Donald Trump: ( 02:08:40 ) It is my great honor to present First Lady Melania Trump.  Speaker 50: ( 02:08:45 ) First Lady Melania Trump.  Speaker 51: ( 02:08:47 ) First Lady Melania Trump, officially kicking off her Be Best Initiative.  Speaker 52: ( 02:08:51 ) She is courageous. She’s taking on a tough topic.  Speaker 51: ( 02:08:54 ) Focused on the wellbeing of children, social media use and opioid abuse.  Melania trump: ( 02:08:58 ) Let’s join together in committing to help children dream big, think big and do all they can to be best in everything they do.  Speaker 52: ( 02:09:07 ) This is her showcasing what she brings to the position of First Lady.  Speaker 50: ( 02:09:10 ) She is smart, independent, and I think people underestimated her big time.  Speaker 53: ( 02:09:15 ) The First Lady was amazing. She was gracious, empathetic and showed true compassion.  Speaker 54: ( 02:09:22 ) First lady, Melania Trump stepping out onto the world stage.  Speaker 55: ( 02:09:26 ) Her Be Best campaign is now going international.  Speaker 52: ( 02:09:29 ) She has the advantage of speaking several languages. She can be a diplomat for our country.  Speaker 56: ( 02:09:34 ) The sun was shining. She was greeted by children. This of course is her continuing to work on her Be Best campaign by shining a spotlight on successful programs that teach children tools and skills.  Speaker 57: ( 02:09:48 ) She represents our country with [inaudible 02:09:49] warmth and elegance and grace.  Melania trump: ( 02:09:52 ) Throughout history, women have made lasting impacts on society and these women represent the strength of the female spirit. As First Lady of the United States, I’m proud of what this country continues to do for women. We as women must continue using our great tool of empowerment – our voices.  Speaker 57: ( 02:10:12 ) It was a very important moment for Melania Trump. This was a really prominent week for her.  Speaker 58: ( 02:10:17 ) The iconic White House Rose Garden has been renovated for the first time in 60 years.  Speaker 59: ( 02:10:23 ) When the history books are written, there should be a special chapter reserved for our first lady.  Speaker 60: ( 02:10:27 ) She is an incredible first lady.  Donald Trump: ( 02:10:29 ) An amazing mother, an incredible woman, First Lady Melania Trump.  Speaker 61: ( 02:10:52 ) Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome the First Lady of the United States, Mrs. Melania Trump.  Melania trump: ( 02:11:59 ) Good evening. It seems like just yesterday that we were at our first convention-  Melania Trump: ( 02:12:03 ) It seems like just yesterday that we were at our first convention where my husband accepted the Republican nomination and then became our 45th president of the United States, yet the energy and enthusiasm for who should lead this nation, it is real today as it was four years ago. I know I speak for my husband and the entire family when I say we have not forgotten the incredible people who were willing to take a chance on the businessmen who had never worked in politics. We know it was you who elected him to be Commander-in-Chief, and we know it is you who will carry us through again. We were humbled by the incredible support then, and we are still grateful today.  Melania Trump: ( 02:12:59 ) I want to acknowledge the fact that since March, our lives have changed drastically. The invisible enemy, COVID-19, swept across our beautiful country and impacted all of us. My deepest sympathy goes out to everyone who has lost a loved one, and my prayers are with those who are ill or suffering. I know many people are anxious and some feel helpless. I want you to know you’re not alone. My husband’s administration will not stop fighting until there is an effective treatment or vaccine available to everyone. Donald will not rest until he has done all he can to take care of everyone impacted by this terrible pandemic. I want to extend my gratitude to all of the healthcare professionals, frontline workers and teachers who stepped up in these difficult times, despite the risk to yourselves and your own families. You put our country first, and my husband and I are grateful.  Melania Trump: ( 02:14:23 ) I have been moved by the way Americans have come together in such an unfamiliar and often frightening situation. It is in times like this that we will look back and tell our grandchildren that through kindness and compassion, strength, and determination we were able to restore the promise of our future. Businesses stepped up and volunteers stepped in. People were eager to share ideas, resources, and support of all kinds with neighbors and strangers alike. It has been inspiring to see what the people of our great nation will do for one another, especially when we are at our most fragile.  Melania Trump: ( 02:15:15 ) Speaking of strength and determination, we recently celebrated the hundred year anniversary of the passage of the 19th Amendment. Yesterday on the North Lawn of the White House, we unveiled an exhibit dedicated to women’s suffrage. The exhibit called on children from across the country to send art honoring the meaning of this important time in women’s history. When I was judging the entries, I reflected on the impact of women’s voices in our nation story and how proud I will be to cast my vote again for Donald this November. We must make sure that women are heard and that the American Dream continues to thrive.  Melania Trump: ( 02:16:09 ) Growing up as a young child in Slovenia, which was under communist rule at the time, I always heard about an amazing place called America, a land that stood for freedom and opportunity. As I grew older, it became my goal to move to the United States and follow my dream working in the fashion industry. My parents work very hard to ensure our family could not only live and prosper in America, but also contribute to a nation that allows for people to arrive with a dream and make it reality. I want to take the moment to thank my mother and father for all they have done for our family. It is because of you that I’m standing here today.  Melania Trump: ( 02:17:10 ) I arrived in the United States when I was 26 years old. Living and working in the land of opportunity was a dream come true, but I wanted more. I wanted to be a citizen. After 10 years of paperwork and patients, I studied for the test in 2006 and became an American citizen. It is still one of the proudest moments in my life, because with hard work and determination, I was able to achieve my own American Dream. As an immigrant and a very independent woman, I understand what a privilege it is to live here and to enjoy the freedoms and opportunities that we have. As First Lady, I have been fortunate to see the American Dream come through over and over again. I have met many inspiring women, children, parents, and families who have overcome life-changing issues that include addiction, homelessness, family members who are ill or have passed away, abuse of all kinds, and many other challenges that would make most people give up. The past three and a half years have been unforgettable. There are no words to describe how honored, humbled and fortunate I am to serve our nation as your First Lady.  Melania Trump: ( 02:18:51 ) After many of the experiences I’ve had, I don’t know if I can fully explain how many people I take home with me in my heart each day, from brave soldiers who give up so much so that we can be free to children of all circumstances, who I have met around the world. Thank you for inspiring me. It is my greatest honor to serve you. When I speak to members of the military, despite sacrificing time with their families, experience the fear of war or suffering loss, they have no regrets about serving our country. The same goes for their families and the families of first responders, who often watch their loved ones out the door, not sure if or when they will come home. When I speak to families who have lost someone, the pain mixed with pride I hear in their voices is something I think about often, so thank you to all who serve our country in the military and as first responders, and thank you to the families who wait for them. You are heroes in your own right.  Melania Trump: ( 02:20:17 ) I have also been moved by the many children and families I’ve spent time with at hospitals, schools and other locations around the world: children who are dealing with pain or illness that would break even the strongest adult, parents who are grateful to wake up every day and see that their child is still alive. These families are a testament to what faith in medicine, strength and science can do. On my first international trip as First Lady, my husband and I visited places of great significance to the three major religions: Islam, Christianity, and Judaism.  Melania Trump: ( 02:21:03 ) One special memory from that trip is of a young boy I had the privilege of visiting while at Bambino Gesu Hospital in Rome, Italy. While there, I read a little boy a story and learned that he and his family had been waiting for a heart for a very long time, and he had a grim prognosis. His situation brought my staff and me to tears, and we spoke of a little ELLs as we flew to Belgium for the next part of our trip. Upon landing just a few hours later, we learned that a heart had been donated and would be going to the little one. I think about him often, along with so many amazing and strong young patients across our own country.  Melania Trump: ( 02:21:55 ) More profound and sadly unavoidable examples of our country’s strength and character have appeared in the communities that have been impacted by natural disasters. Hurricanes, tornadoes, and flooding may show the ugly side of mother nature, but in their aftermath, they can show us a beautiful side of humanity. My husband and I have visited many places that have been affected by natural disaster, and we are deeply moved by the strength of the people who have lost everything and the kindness of neighbors and communities. The common thread in all of these challenging situations is the unwavering resolve to help one another. I recognize the stories I just told are about people who survive extraordinary circumstances, but Donald and I are also inspired by the millions of Americans who wake up each day with a simple, yet courageous goal of providing for their families and keeping them safe. You are the backbone of this country. You are the people who continue to make the United States of America what it is and who have the incredible responsibility of preparing our future generations to leave everything even better than they found it. Just as you are fighting for your families, my husband, our family, and the people in this administration are here fighting for you. No matter the amount of negative or false media headlines or attacks from the other side, Donald Trump has not and will not lose focus on you. He loves this country and he knows how to get things done. As you have learned over the past five years, he’s not a traditional politician. He doesn’t just speak words. He demands action and he gets results. The future of our country has always been very important to him, and it is something that I have always admired. In fact, it is to help ensure a better future for our next generation that I launched Be Best, my initiative to help children achieve their fullest potential. Be Best has one simple goal: teaching youth about the importance of their wellbeing, both mentally and physically. This also includes understanding online safety and the danger of opioid and drug abuse.  Melania Trump: ( 02:24:52 ) Through Be Best, my office and I have been able to highlight people, programs and organizations that are doing extraordinary things in our country and around the world. I continue to believe that by shining a light on these positive examples, others across the country and globe will become inspired to theater a part for our next generation. Helping children is not a political goal. It is our moral imperative. When I think back to a defining moment of Be Best, my mind goes to a trip I took to Africa. On that vast and beautiful continent, I was able to visit the countries of Ghana, Malawi, Kenya, and Egypt. One of those visits in particular had a profound impact on me. Ghana on the coast of West Africa was the first stop on my trip, and I experienced firsthand it’s warm people and their traditions.  Melania Trump: ( 02:26:04 ) While there, I visited the Cape Coast Castle and learn more about the beginning of a cruel and often deadly journey in the era of the slave trade. I was horrified when I listened to the guide tell me so many inhumane stories, and I gained new perspectives. This time in our history, we must never forget so that we can ensure that it never happens again. Like all of you, I have reflected on the racial unrest in our country. It is a harsh reality that we are not proud of parts of our history. I encourage people to focus on our future while still learning from our past. We must remember that today, we are all one community comprised of many races, religions and ethnicities. Our diverse and storied history is what makes our country strong, and yet we still have so much to learn from one another.  Melania Trump: ( 02:27:17 ) With that in mind, I’d like to call on the citizens of this country to take a moment, pause and look at things from all perspectives. I urge people to come together in a civil manner so we can work and live up to our standard American ideals. I also ask people to stop the violence and looting being done in the name of justice and never make assumptions based on the color of a person’s skin. Instead of tearing things down, let’s reflect on our mistakes. Be proud of our evolution and look to our way forward every day. Let us remember that we are one nation under God, and we need to cherish one another.  Melania Trump: ( 02:28:16 ) My husband’s administration has worked to try and affect change when it comes to issues around race and religion in this country. He’s the first president to address a special session of the United Nations General Assembly to call upon countries across the world to end religious prosecution and honor the right of every person to worship as they choose. He has made substantial investments in our historically Black colleges and universities. This president also continues to fight for school choice, giving parents more options to help their children flourish. My husband knows how to make a real change. From the day that I met him, he has only wanted to make this country the best it can be. For many years, I watched him grow concerned and frustrated, and I’m so proud to see the many things he has done in such a short time. America is in his heart, so while at times we only see the worst of people and politics on the evening news, let’s remember how we come together in the most difficult times.  Melania Trump: ( 02:29:40 ) And while debate rage on about issues of race, let’s focus on the strides we have made and work together for a better tomorrow for everyone. Our administration has also devoted historic resources and produced lifesaving results by raising awareness around opiod addiction and drug abuse, especially for children. When so often the headlines are filled with gossip, I want to take this moment to encourage the media to focus even more on the nation’s drug crisis. This disease is one that affects everybody. It pays no attention to race, age or socioeconomic status. Addiction has touched every part of our society in some way, and now more than ever, we have programs in medicine to combat it. We just need to talk about it openly, and you, the media, have the platforms to make that happen.  Melania Trump: ( 02:30:48 ) To the media industry and as a country, I ask that we all commit to helping in our fight against drug addiction, by talking about it even more. Especially as we battle the COVID pandemic, we need to remember that suicides are on the rise as people who are struggling with loneliness and addiction feel they have nowhere to turn. Parents, please talk to your children. Teachers and caregivers, pay attention to signs of addiction. Lawmakers, pass legislation that allows those who ask for help to do so safely and without fear, and to provide resources for organizations that help people impacted by addiction. When the stigma is removed, people will no longer be ashamed to ask for help and lives will be saved. And if you are struggling with addiction, there is no shame in your illness. Please seek help. You’re worth it.  Melania Trump: ( 02:31:59 ) In my next four years as first lady, I will continue to build upon Be Best and work with individual states to pass legislation to take care of our most vulnerable. I plan to continue the work I have started with children in foster care, as well as the minority communities and tribal nations. I want to ensure children are being protected and communities have the resources needed to combat drug addiction and child neglect or abuse. Like my husband and the administration, I will continue to encourage education that supports a child’s individual needs. It is vital that children are given the building blocks to succeed. I also look forward to continue my work to restore The People’s House, which is a lasting symbol of pride for our nation. I believe this iconic home needs to be cared for and preserved, so it can be enjoyed by the people of this country and visitor from around the world for years to come. I’m passionate about this beautiful house, the grounds, and all they represent.  Melania Trump: ( 02:33:18 ) And now I have a special message for the mothers of this country. This modern world is moving so fast, and our children face challenges that seem to change every few months. Just like me, I know many of you watch how mean and manipulative social media can be, and just like me, I’m sure many of you are looking for answers, how to talk to your children about the downside of technology and their relationships with their peers. Like every parent in this country, I feel there are so many lessons to teach our son and the responsibilities as his mother, but there just not enough hours in the day to do it all. I remind myself that I’m more fortunate than most, and still have days that I look for wisdom and strength to the very best I can for him. To mothers and parents everywhere, you’re warriors.  Melania Trump: ( 02:34:24 ) In my husband, you have a president who will not stop fighting for you and your families. I see how hard he works each day and night, and despite the unprecedented attacks from the media and opposition, he will not give up. In fact, if you tell him he cannot be done, he just works harder. Donald is a husband who supports me in all that I do. He has built an administration with an unprecedented number of women in leadership roles, and has fostered an environment where the American people are always the priority. He welcomes different points of view and encourage thinking outside of the box. I know I speak for my husband and the family when I say we are so grateful that you have trusted him to be your president, and we will be honored to serve this incredible country for four more years. As you have heard this evening, I don’t want to use this precious time attacking the other side, because as we saw last week, that kind of talk only serves to divide the country further. I’m here because we need my husband to be our president and commander-in-chief for four more years. He’s what is best for our country. We all know Donald Trump makes no secrets about how he feels about things. Total honesty is what we as citizens deserve from our president. Whether you like it or not, you always know what he’s thinking, and that is because he’s an authentic person who loves this country and its people and wants to continue to make it better. Donald wants to keep your family safe. He wants to help your family succeed. He wants nothing more than for this country to prosper, and he doesn’t waste time playing politics.  Melania Trump: ( 02:36:48 ) Almost four years ago, we went into election day completely underestimated. Despite what is being said again this year, I know just as you do that, Americans will go to the polls and will, on the behalf of their families, our economy, our national security and our children’s future. To vote for those ideas is not a partisan vote. It is a common sense vote, because those are goals and hopes that we all believe in. I believe that we need my husband’s leadership now more than ever in order to bring us back once again to the greatest economy and the strongest country ever known. God bless you all, your families, and God bless the United States of America.

Speaker 1: ( 00:00 ) Thing, it was never intended to be, but the spirit of heroism stands in the breach. It lives in the heart. It breathes in the soul and is woven into the courageous fabric of Americans, like you. It preserves liberty. It strengthens families. It empowers the extraordinary. The spirit of heroism inspires us to act when others are in need, to do the right thing. Join us tonight. Dream heroic dreams. Celebrate America, land of the free, home of the brave.  Speaker 2: ( 00:52 ) From Washington DC, welcome to the 2020 Republican National Convention. Tonight, celebrating America, the land of heroes.  Speaker 3: ( 01:19 ) Lord, all mighty God, we come before you this evening and pray for your divine protection over our brothers and sisters in the path of storms along our Gulf Coast. You are our rock and our shelter in the midst of the storms of life. You are the God who commands the winds and the waves, and we pray that you will provide refuge to our people. Oh Lord, you have granted us certain natural rights, such as the right to speak freely, life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness, as well as religious freedom, the right to assemble and the right to self-defense. Only in America have these God-given rights so flourished and been categorized as belonging to the people, embodying the very essence of our government. Father, we pray that this outlook and mindset, this form of government continues, as has been our history, especially now when to our horror, it is being challenged.  Speaker 3: ( 02:29 ) So, we pray that God gives strength and health to our President, who has splendidly demonstrated daily, his determination to defend and maintain the God-given rights of our citizens as enshrined in our constitution, and in our declaration, eloquently passed down through our Judeo-Christian tradition. President Trump has stood up fearlessly against those who are corrupting the term social justice, so as to deny Americans, their birthright and these divine gifts. May God protect him. May God bless all those in government and among our citizens who seek to honor, defend and preserve our heritage.  Speaker 3: ( 03:19 ) This land was founded in an epic and providential moment. Like the revelation at Sinai, it was the moment when the vision of God rendezvoused with this soaring and Nobel plans of appointed men. Yet, every so often, a pace, various generations, we are compelled to resurrect and give rebirth to our providential beginning, to renew our present days with the exuberance of those founding days. Perhaps that is what is meant when we say make America great again. We pledge to vigilantly protect and tend the garden, so as to imbibe its blessed fruits. May God continue to make America great, and may we continue to be his people, one nation, under God. Let us say, amen.  Speaker 4: ( 04:24 ) I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible with liberty and justice for all.  Kristi Noem: ( 04:50 ) Good evening. I’m Governor Kristi Noem, of South Dakota. I’m here tonight because I believe America is an exceptional nation, founded on three principles, equality, freedom, and opportunity. But today, our founding principles are under attack. This year, the choice for Americans is between a man who values these ideals and all that can be built because of them and a man who isn’t guided by these ideals, and coincidentally has built nothing. Remember, America’s battle for independence and fight for self-governance was something that had never been done before. Men of great intellect and wisdom like James Madison, the father of our constitution, hoped our constitutional republic would last for ages, mitigate the problems that would naturally arise from political factions and prevent tyranny. Madison also authored much of the Bill of Rights, because he understood the natural tendency of government to increasingly encroach on the people’s consent and thus, our freedom.  Kristi Noem: ( 05:55 ) He urged his colleagues to adopt these amendments to enshrine in our constitution the ideals laid out in the Declaration of Independence, that all power comes from the people, that the government is created and ought to be exercised for the benefit of the people. Our constitution guarantees the right to speak, to assemble, and to worship, the right to arm ourselves as a counterbalance to a standing army and the right to a fair and equitable criminal justice system. We must fight to protect these foundational rights from government interference and indifference. America is unique in the world. Governments power at all levels is limited to the confines of our constitution, which protects our God-given liberties and civil rights. We are not, and will not be the subjects of an elite class of so- called experts. We, the people are the government. Now at times, our country has struggled to live up to our founding principles. Another great American, Abraham Lincoln, knew that struggle better than anybody. When he was just 28 years old, Honest Abe saw wild and furious passion’s worse than savage mobs, he said, taking the place of reasoned judgment. He was alarmed by the increasing disregard for the rule of law throughout the country. He was concerned for the people that had seen their property destroyed, their families attacked and their lives threatened, or even taken away. These good people were becoming tired of and disgusted with a government that offered them no protection. Sound familiar? It took 244 years to build this great nation, flaws and all, but we stand to lose it in a tiny fraction of that time, if we continue down the path taken by the Democrats and their radical supporters. From Seattle and Portland to Washington and New York, Democrat-run cities across this country are being overrun by violent mobs.  Kristi Noem: ( 08:03 ) The violence is rampant. There’s looting, chaos, destruction, and murder. People that can afford to flee, have fled, but the people that can’t, good, hardworking Americans are left to fend for themselves. The Republican Party’s commitment to individual rights and self-government is as necessary today as it was in 1860, when we won our first presidential election. Our party respects individuals, based on who they are. We don’t divide people based on their beliefs or their roots. We don’t shun people who think for themselves. We respect to everyone equally under the constitution, and we treat them as Martin Luther King, Jr. wished, according to the content of their character, not the color of their skin. In just four years, President Trump has lifted people of all races and backgrounds out of poverty. He shrunk government. He put money back into the pockets of hardworking, ordinary Americans. He has advanced religious liberty.  Kristi Noem: ( 09:10 ) He protected the Second Amendment. You can look back 50 years. You won’t find anyone that has surpassed President Trump’s success on these four issues alone. History chooses its heroes for the time in which they live. At our founding, Madison was one of the chosen. When the nation’s very existence was challenged, it was Lincoln’s turn. Thanks to these men, america is a land of hope. Their examples have been repeated in countless ways by simple Americans following their conscience, but there is another American hero to be recognized, and that is the common American. This is who President Trump is fighting for. He is fighting for you.  Speaker 5: ( 09:56 ) I’m Scott Dane. I represent loggers and truckers in Minnesota, but I also represent a way of life. Logging has been a part of the great American story from the beginning. In fact, if you go to the Capitol rotunda and look up, you can see loggers on one of the panels, New England settlers carving out a new world from the wilderness. But logging is the most dangerous job in the country, but we embrace that risk because we know America was built by strong people, building things together. America needs us to keep building and we can’t wait to be a part of it. But the last time Joe Biden was in the White House, Minnesota lost nearly half of its mills, thousands of jobs and experienced nearly a decade of decline. It was a similar story in other parts of the country. The administration just didn’t seem to care.  Speaker 5: ( 11:06 ) In 47 years in Washington, Joe Biden, hasn’t done anything for the timber industry. When plants closed in Duluth, Sartell, Cook and Bemidji, they were just numbers on a paper to the Obama Biden administration. To me, they were people in jobs and families. Under Obama-Biden, radical environmentalist, who were allowed to kill the forests, wildfire after wildfire shows the consequences. Managed forests, the kind of my people work in, are healthy forests. Under President Trump, we’ve seen a new recognition of the value of forest management in reducing wildfires. We’ve seen new support for our way of life, where a strong back and a strong work ethic can build a strong middle class. We want to build families where we were raised and stand by communities that stood by us. We want that way of life available for the next generation, and we want our forests there too. President Trump, thank you for helping us do just that  Marsha Blackburn: ( 12:28 ) Hi, I’m US Senator Marsha Blackburn from Tennessee. America is a nation of heroes. In times of difficulty, we’re reminded that they’re all around us. They’re in the line with us at the grocery store, in the pew with us at church. They’re the regular Americans who step up to volunteer and serve when we need them most. They’ve stood at the forefront throughout this pandemic. The emergency room nurses who go back shift after shift, the medical researchers, developing a vaccine and therapies to combat what the Chinese communist regime unleashed on the world. Cookeville’s Double Springs Church of Christ members, lifting our country up in prayer and providing for those impacted by tragedy. But tonight I want to talk to you about another kind of hero. The kind Democrats don’t recognize because they don’t fit into their narrative. I’m talking about the heroes of our law enforcement and armed services.  Marsha Blackburn: ( 13:45 ) LeftistS try to turn them into villains. They want to cancel them, but I’m here to tell you these heroes can’t be canceled. Tennessee is full of them. After all, we’re the Volunteer State. My dad served in the army in World War II. When he came home, he put on another uniform and for 30 years volunteered to help our underfunded Sheriff’s Department. I’m reminded of him when ever I see compassion and selflessness and others. When I see law enforcement officers put their lives on the line every single day to keep our community safe, in spite of the hatred thrown at them. When I see the heroes who volunteer to serve our country, putting their lives on the line for our freedom, many of these heroes called Tennessee home, and we could not be more proud of the brave men and women of the 101st Airborne Division at Fort Campbell. The common thread between them is a deep-seated desire to serve a cause larger than themselves. They don’t believe their country owes them anything. They believe they owe their country and their fellow man. As hard as Democrats try, they can’t cancel our heroes. They can’t contest their bravery and they can’t dismiss the powerful sense of service that lives deep in their souls. They tried to defund them, our military, our police, even ICE, to take away their tools to keep us safe. Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, and their radical allies, try to destroy these heroes because if there are no heroes to inspire us, government can control us. They close our churches, but keep the liquor stores and abortion clinics open. They say we can’t gather in community groups, but encourage protests, riots and looting in the streets.  Marsha Blackburn: ( 16:16 ) If the Democrats had their way, they would keep you locked in your house until you become dependent on the government for everything. That sounds a lot like Communist China, to me. Maybe that’s why Joe Biden is so soft on them. Why Nancy Pelosi says that China would prefer Joe Biden. Yeah. I bet they would. But, President Trump has stood up for our heroes every day. He stood by our law enforcement, our military and the freedoms we hold dear. He’s made good on his promise to put America first. I hope you will stand with me, as we send him back for four more years, with the clear message to the Democrats, you will never cancel our heroes.  Dan Crenshaw: ( 17:18 ) Hi, I’m Congressman Dan Crenshaw. Eight years ago in the fields of Helmand Province, Afghanistan, a close friend and teammate laid down, cover fire against Taliban and surgeons so that I could walk, blind and bloodied to the medevac helicopter and survive. But he didn’t. Dave Orson was killed two months later. He died a hero to this great country. Here’s the truth about America. We are a country of heroes. I believe that. So should you. We are a people with a common set of ideals, conceived in liberty, people that have sacrificed time and again for our freedom and the freedom of others. That’s something no other country ever, anywhere can claim. Since 911, I’ve seen America’s heroes up close. Some of them saved my life. Some of them saved many other’s lives. Many of them never made it home. These heroes acted as if the whole struggle depended on them alone, as if any weakness on their part would be a reflection of the whole nation.  Dan Crenshaw: ( 18:22 ) That’s called duty, and America has a long history of it. Our enemies fear us because Americans fight for good, and we know it. It gives us strength. When our heroes are trusted and equipped, then freedom prevails. The defeat of ISIS was the result of America believing in our heroes, our President having their backs and rebuilding our military, so we’d have what we needed to finish the mission. The cowering of the Iranian regime and the restoration of the deterrence once lost is the result of America believing in her own might again. America’s heroism isn’t relegated to the battlefield. Every single day we see them, if you just know where to look. It’s the nurse, who volunteers for back to back shifts, caring for COVID patients because she feels that’s her duty. It’s the parent who will relearn algebra because there’s no way they’re letting their kid fall behind while schools are closed.  Dan Crenshaw: ( 19:18 ) It’s the cop that gets spit on one day and will save a child’s life the next, America is the country where the young military wife with two young children answers the unexpected knock at the door, looks the man in uniform in the eye, and even as her whole world comes crashing down, she stands up straight. She holds back tears and takes care of her family because she must. This is what heroism looks like. It’s who we are, a nation of heroes and we need you now more than ever. We need to remind ourselves what heroism really is. Heroism is self-sacrifice. It’s not moralizing and lecturing over others when they disagree. Heroism is grace, not perpetual outrage. Heroism is rebuilding our communities, not destroying them. Heroism is renewing faith in the symbols that unite us, not tearing them down. You see, America is a fabric that’s woven from the threads of history’s best stories, best attributes and greatest ideas.  Dan Crenshaw: ( 20:20 ) The American spirit reflects the oldest and most important virtues, self-sacrifice, courage, tolerance, love of country, grace and passion for human achievement. We can decide right now, that American greatness will not be rejected nor squandered, because the American founding was grounded in individual liberty. So, it will be our future. But if we are to rediscover our strength, then it must be an endeavor undertaken by each and one of us. We must become the heroes that we so admire. America was built by them and our future will be protected by them. It will be protected by you. So, God bless America.  Keith Kellogg: ( 21:09 ) Good evening. I’m retired Lieutenant general, Keith Kellogg. In 1967, at the age of 22, I volunteered to serve my country in Vietnam. From the jungles of Vietnam to the deserts of Iraq, I have gone where my nation asked. I have borne witness to soldier’s last moments on earth, their lives spent in hope and promise of a better future for all Americans. I was in the Pentagon on September 11th, 2001. I lost friends there that day. In the years that followed, I watched my daughter, son and son-in-law deploy to Afghanistan. I have looked into the eyes of my grandchildren, as they said goodbye to their fathers and hugged them one last time. I live to service. I understand sacrifice. I know leadership. Over the past three and a half years, I have witnessed every major foreign policy and national security decision by the President. I have been in the room where it happened.  Keith Kellogg: ( 22:22 ) I saw only one agenda, and one guiding question when tough calls had to be made. Is this decision right for America? When President Donald Trump took office decades of failed foreign policy had crippled us. He faced wars without end in sight, creation of failed states like Libya and Syria, a pass that allowed a terrorist caliphate to grow and leadership in Washington that allowed our military to atrophy, while we spent trillions of dollars abroad, instead of investing at home. President Trump has reversed the decline of our military and restructured our national security strategy with historic investment and vision.  Keith Kellogg: ( 23:10 ) Our military is now better equipped, better resourced and better manned than any military in the world. President Trump demolished the terrorist ISIS caliphate in the Middle East and eliminated its leader, al-Baghdadi, one of the world’s most brutal terrorists. President Trump took decisive action against Iranian terrorist mastermind, Qasem Soleimani, a man responsible for deaths of hundreds of American service men in Iraq. When our NATO allies failed to meet their commitments, as we upheld ours, President Trump demanded parody. NATO members have now increased their contributions over $100 billion this year, and NATO’s secretary general credits President Donald J. Trump.  Keith Kellogg: ( 24:03 ) President Trump challenged and continues to challenge an ever- increasingly provocative and militant China, but make no mistake. President Trump is no Hawk. He wisely wheels the sword when required, but believes in seeking peace instead of perpetual conflict. Just over a week ago, our President brokered a peace agreement between the United Arab Emirates and Israel, the first in the Middle East in over 25 years. This week, Afghan negotiators, with help from American officials, will start peace negotiations between the Taliban and the Afghan government to end America’s longest war. Ask yourself, has this President kept his promises to keep us out of needless conflicts and to pursue ending wars without end? Has he defended your interests in renegotiating trade deals that previously hurt Americans international security?  Keith Kellogg: ( 25:13 ) Has he fulfilled his Commander in Chief role, by decisively going after our nation’s enemies? You and I know, the answer is yes. The choice is clear. This is the most important election of our lifetime. The next four years will decide the course of our country for decades to come. I am asking you to stand up and be counted, so we never have to look back and recall what it was once like in America when men and women were free, our families were secure and we had a President who served the people. God bless America. Thank you, and goodnight.  Tera Myers: ( 26:23 ) Good evening. My name is Tara Myers. Tonight, I am here as a wife and mother, to share how education freedom has personally impacted my family, especially the life of my son, Samuel. Before Samuel was even born, I was told his life wouldn’t be worth living. When early tests revealed he had Down syndrome, our doctor encouraged me to terminate the pregnancy. He said, “If you do not, you will be burdening your life, your family, and your community.” I knew my baby was a human being, created by God and that made him worthy of life. I am thankful that President Trump values the life of the unborn. When we went to register Samuel for kindergarten, we were told to just put him where he would be comfortable. Don’t stress him out by trying to teach him. When we pushed for him to attend his neighborhood school with his sisters, we were told, “Just go home and let us do what we do.”  Tera Myers: ( 27:28 ) When I inquired about functional learning, I was told, “This is all you get, like it or not.” Well, I did not like it. One size did not fit all. So, I helped fight to pass legislation in Ohio for a special needs scholarship, so that all students could choose the right program for their needs. I worked to start a new functional learning program at our local private school. Finally, Samuel had an appropriate place to learn. Last December, Samuel was invited to the White House to meet our President and share his thoughts on education freedom. He said, “School choice helped my dreams come true. My school taught me the way I learn best. I was able to fit in. I made many friends. I became a part of my community. My teachers helped me become the best I can be.”  Tera Myers: ( 28:25 ) President Trump shook my hand and said, Wonderful job, mom. Your son is amazing.” Unlike the doctor who told me to end Samuel’s life before it even began, President Trump did not dismiss my son. He showed Samuel, he valued him and was proud of what he accomplished. President Trump gave Samuel an equal seat at the table. Tonight, I would like to extend my thanks to President Trump and his administration for their work towards making every student’s dream of a meaningful education, a reality, and for fighting to ensure every child in America has an equal seat at the table of education freedom, and an equal opportunity in life. Thank you, and may God bless America.  Speaker 6: ( 29:40 ) It all started at a tea party. 13 years before the American Civil War, civil unrest and division separated countrymen into two opposing camps, one determined to keep African-American people enslaved. The other, determined to see all people free. Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Lucretia Mott felt the call to fight for that freedom, when they were selected as delegates for an anti-slavery convention. But, upon arrival, were told they could not speak or vote at the male-dominated event. On July 9th, 1848, Mott, Stanton, and three other women met for tea. By the end of the day, they’d formed a coalition with the sole purpose of gaining the right for women to vote, so they in turn would be free to fight for the freedoms of others. Women across America united and formed activist groups, working tirelessly to win the vote for American women. The unconquerable Susan B. Anthony became one of the most visible leaders of women’s suffrage, when in 1872, she registered and voted for every Republican on the ballot.  Speaker 6: ( 30:50 ) As punishment for her actions, she was arrested for illegal voting. At the request of Susan B. Anthony, Senator A. A. Sergent introduced the 19th amendment in 1878. The Susan B. Anthony amendment was submitted and defeated four times, but women continue to fight. Sojourner Truth and many other black suffragettes defied segregation, fighting for all women’s voices to be heard and allowed to vote. For the two years prior to ratification, the Silent Sentinels quietly picketed the White House. Finally, when Republicans regained control of Congress on August 26, 1920, the Equal Suffrage amendment was signed into law. Women’s suffrage movement took 72 years and would change the lives of women forever.  Speaker 6: ( 31:39 ) The victory was achieved peacefully through the valiant efforts of women patriots and the democratic process. 100 years later, in a bold declaration of rights for women, President Trump granted a full pardon to Susan B. Anthony, on the 100th anniversary of the 19th amendment ratification. Women’s suffrage was born from a desire to fight for the freedom of others. Now we, the great patriots of America will band together once again, and with one unified voice, we will vote for freedom.  Kayleigh McEnany: ( 32:24 ) I’m Kayleigh McEnany. You may know me as a supporter of President Trump, but tonight I’m here to share with you how he supported me, both as a new mom and as an American with a preexisting condition. When I was 21 years old, I got a call that changed my life. It was my doctor informing me that I had tested positive for the BRCA-2 genetic mutation, a mutation that put my chances of breast cancer at 84%. It was the same mutation that my mom, had compelling her to get a preventative, double mastectomy, removing her breast tissue, but protecting her from a disease that has taken far too many of our mothers, our sisters, our friends. In my family, eight women alone were diagnosed with breast cancer, several in their young twenties. I now faced the same prospect.  Kayleigh McEnany: ( 33:27 ) For nearly a decade. I was routinely at Moffitt Cancer Center, getting MRIs, ultrasounds, and necessary surveillance. During these visits, I crossed paths with brave women battling cancer and fighting through chemotherapy. They were a testament to American strength. They are American heroes. On May 1st, 2018, I followed in my mother’s footsteps, choosing to get a preventative mastectomy. I was scared. The night before I fought back-  Kayleigh McEnany: ( 34:03 ) I was scared. The night before I fought back tears as I prepared to lose a piece of myself forever, but the next day, with my mom, dad, husband and Jesus Christ by my side, I underwent a mastectomy, almost eliminating my chance of breast cancer, a decision I now celebrate.  Kayleigh McEnany: ( 34:26 ) Breast reconstruction has advanced remarkably. While it is an individual’s decision, my doctor and I chose a course of surgery that left me virtually unchanged, but more important than physical results, I developed a strength and a confidence that I carry with me. During one of my most difficult times, I expected to have the support of my family, but I had more support than I knew. As I came out of anesthesia, one of the first calls I received was from Ivanka Trump. As I recovered, my phone rang again. It was President Trump, calling to check on me. I was blown away. Here was the leader of the free world caring about my circumstance. At the time I had only met President Trump on a few occasions, but now, I know him well, and I can tell you that this president stands by Americans with pre-existing conditions. In fact, President Trump called me this morning, I spoke with him several times today and he told me how proud he was of me for sharing this story.  Kayleigh McEnany: ( 35:40 ) The same way President Trump has supported me, he supports you. I see it every day. I’ve heard him say the hardest part of his job is writing to loved ones of fallen soldiers, I’ve seen him offer heartfelt outreach to grieving parents who lost their children to crime in the streets, and I’ve watched him fight for Americans who lost their jobs. President Trump fights for the American people because he cares about stories like these. I have a nine-month-old daughter. She is a beautiful sweet little girl and I choose to work for this president for her. When I look into my baby’s eyes, I see a new life, a miracle for which I have a solemn responsibility to protect. That means protecting America’s future, a future President Trump will fight for. Where our neighborhoods are protected, where life is sacred, where God is cherished, not taken out of our schools, removed from our pledge, and erased from our history. I want my daughter to grow up in President Donald J. Trump’s America.  Kayleigh McEnany: ( 37:10 ) Choosing to have a preventative mastectomy was the hardest decision I ever had to make, but supporting President Trump, who will protect my daughter and our children’s future was the easiest.  Karen Pence: ( 37:27 ) Good evening. I’m Karen Pence. My husband is Vice President Mike Pence. 100 years ago today, the 19th Amendment was adopted into the United States Constitution, guaranteeing women the right to vote. Because of heroes like Susan B. Anthony and Lucy Stone, women today like our daughters Audrey and Charlotte and future generations will have their voices heard and their votes count. The women’s suffrage movement was the gateway that led to women having the opportunities to achieve monumental milestones and accomplish significant achievements in both civic and governmental roles. This evening, we look at heroes in our land. As Second Lady of the United States for the past three and a half years, I have had the honor of meeting many heroes across this great country. The Pences are a military family. Our son Michael serves in the United States Marines and our son-in-law Henry serves in the U.S. Navy, and one of my key initiatives is to elevate and encourage military spouses. These men and women, like our daughter Charlotte and our daughter-in-law Sarah, are the home front heroes. I have been privileged to hear so many stories of selfless support, volunteer spirit and great contributions to the armed forces and our communities.  Karen Pence: ( 39:23 ) You know military spouses may experience frequent moves and job changes, periods of being a single parent while their loved one is deployed, all while exhibiting pride, strength and determination and being a part of something bigger than themselves. To all of the military spouses, thank you.  Karen Pence: ( 39:46 ) President Trump and Vice President Pence have been supporting our United States Armed Forces, including our military families on a significant scale. While traveling throughout our nation to educate military spouses about policy solutions that President Trump has promoted involving real, tangible progress in military spouse employment, I have been inspired to meet heroes like Lisa Bradley and Cameron Cruz. These military spouses decided to start their own business, R. Riveter, named after the Rosie the Riveter campaign used to recruit women workers during World War II. R. Riveter makes beautiful handbags designed and manufactured exclusively by military spouses and many of those spouses live all over the country. They prepare and send their section of the bags to the company located in North Carolina where the final product is assembled.  Karen Pence: ( 40:53 ) Military spouse hero Jilan Hall-Johnson in Billings, Montana is a culinary artist who had dreamed of starting her own restaurant. Working with the Small Business Administration’s development center, Jilan started her restaurant, The Sassy Biscuit, and she just opened a second restaurant in Dover, New Hampshire. As the Second Lady, I’ve also been able to bring awareness to a form of therapy for our heroic veterans suffering from PTSD. Art therapy facilitated by a professional art therapist is especially effective with post-traumatic stress disorder. Master gunnery sergeant Chris Stowe, a Marine veteran I met in Tampa, who deployed for combat in Iraq and Afghanistan, said nothing had helped him deal with the trauma from his service in the Marines until he finally agreed to meet with the art therapist at Walter Reed Medical Center. Chris credits art therapy with saving his marriage and his life, and Chris went on to establish a glassblowing workshop to help other vets.  Karen Pence: ( 42:10 ) Many of our veteran heroes struggle as they transition back into civilian life and sometimes the stress is too difficult to manage alone. A few weeks ago, I had the honor of speaking with some amazing Americans who answer the veterans crisis line. One in particular, Sidney Morgan, especially impacted me. A veteran herself, Sidney said it is the highest honor of her life until they physically walk into a clinic to receive help they deserve and she can pass their hand to someone ready to help. In these difficult times, we’ve all seen so many examples of everyday Americans reaching out a hand to those in need. Those who in humility have considered others more important than themselves. We’ve seen healthcare workers, teachers, first responders, mental health providers, law enforcement officers, grocery and delivery workers, and farmers and so many others. Heroes all.  Karen Pence: ( 43:27 ) 100 years ago, women secured the right to vote, so let’s vote America. Let’s honor our heroes, let’s re-elect President Trump and Vice President Pence for four more years. God bless our heroes and God bless the United States of America.  Speaker 7: ( 43:51 ) We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights that among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.  Kellyanne Conway: ( 44:11 ) Good evening. I’m Kellyanne Conway. 100 years ago, courageous warriors helped women secure the right to vote. This has been a century worth celebrating but also a reminder that our democracy is young and fragile. A woman in a leadership role can still seem novel. Not so for President Trump. For decades, he has elevated women to senior positions in business and in government. He confides in and consults us, respects our opinions, and insists that we are on equal footing with the men. President Trump helped me shatter a barrier in the world of politics by empowering me to manage his campaign to its successful conclusion. With the help of millions of Americans, our team defied the critics, the naysayers, the conventional wisdom, and we won. For many of us, women’s empowerment is not a slogan. It comes not from strangers on social media or sanitized language in a corporate handbook. It comes from the everyday heroes who nurture us, who shape us, and who believe in us.  Kellyanne Conway: ( 45:25 ) I was raised in a household of all women. They were self-reliant and resilient. Their lives were not easy, but they never complained. Money was tight, but we had an abundance of what mattered most, family, faith and freedom. I learned that in America, limited means does not make for limited dreams. The promise of America belongs to us all. This is a land of inventors and innovators, of entrepreneurs and educators, of pioneers and parents, each contributing to the success and the future of a great nation and her people. These everyday heroes have a champion in President Trump. The teacher who took extra time to help students adjust to months of virtual learning. The nurse who finished a 12-hour COVID shift and then took a brief break only to change her mask, gown and gloves to do it all over again. The small business owner striving to reopen after the lockdown was lifted, and then again after her store was vandalized and looted. The single mom with two kids, two jobs, two commutes, who 10 years after that empty promise, finally has health insurance. President Trump and Vice President Pence have lifted Americans, provided them with dignity, opportunity, and results.  Kellyanne Conway: ( 47:08 ) I have seen firsthand many times the president comforting and encouraging a child who has lost a parent, a parent who has lost a child, a worker who lost his job, an adolescent who lost her way to drugs. Don’t lose hope, he has told them, assuring them that they are not alone, and that they matter. There always will be people who have far more than us. Our responsibility is to focus on those who have far less than us. President Trump has done precisely that in taking unprecedented action to combat this nation’s drug crisis. He told me, “This is so important, Kellyanne. So many lives have been ruined by addiction and we’ll never even know it because people are ashamed to reach out for help and they’re not even sure who to turn to in their toughest hour.” Rather than look the other way, President Trump stared directly at this drug crisis next door, and through landmark bipartisan legislation, has helped secure historic investments in surveillance, interdiction, education, prevention, treatment, and recovery. We have a long way to go, but the political inertia that cost lives and the silence and the stigma that prevents people in need from coming forward is melting away.  Kellyanne Conway: ( 48:44 ) This is the man I know and the president we need for four more years. He picks the toughest fights and tackles the most complex problems. He has stood by me and he will stand up for you. In honor of the women who empowered me and for the future of the children we all cherish, thank you, and God bless you always.  Sister Dede Byrne: ( 49:27 ) Good evening. I’m Sister Dede Byrne and I belong to the Community of the Little Workers of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary. Last Fourth of July, I was honored to be one of the president’s guests at his salute to America celebration. I must confess that I recently prayed while in chapel, begging God to allow me to be a voice, an instrument for human life, and now here I am, speaking at the Republican National Convention. I guess you better be careful for what you pray for.  Sister Dede Byrne: ( 49:59 ) My journey to a religious life was not a traditional route if there is such a thing. In 1978 as a medical school student at Georgetown University, I joined the army to help pay for my tuition and ended up devoting 29 years to the military, serving as a doctor and a surgeon in places like Afghanistan and Egypt’s Sinai Peninsula. After much prayer and contemplation I entered my religious order in 2002, working to serve the poor and the sick in Haiti, Sudan, Kenya, Iraq and in Washington, D.C. Humility is at the foundation of our order which makes it very difficult to talk about myself but I can speak about my experience working for those fleeing, war-torn and impoverished countries all around the world. Those refugees all share a common experience. They have been all marginalized, viewed as insignificant, powerless and voiceless. And while we tend to think of the marginalized as living beyond our borders, the truth is the largest marginalized group in the world can be found here in the United States, they are the unborn.  Sister Dede Byrne: ( 51:17 ) As Christians, we first met Jesus as a stirring embryo in the womb of an unwed mother and saw him born nine months later in the poverty of the cave. It’s no coincidence that Jesus stood up for what was just and was ultimately crucified because what he said wasn’t politically correct or fashionable. As followers of Christ, we are called to stand up for life against the politically correct or fashionable of today. We must fight against a legislative agenda that supports and even celebrates destroying life in the womb. Keep in mind the laws we create define how we see our humanity and we must ask ourselves what are we saying when we go into a womb and snuff out an innocent, powerless voice’s life? As a physician I can say without hesitation life begins at conception. While what I have to say may be difficult for some to hear, I am saying it because I’m not just pro-life, I’m pro-eternal life and I want all of us to end up in heaven together some day.  Sister Dede Byrne: ( 52:28 ) Which brings me to why I’m here today. Donald Trump is the most pro-life president that this nation has ever had, defending life at all stages. His belief in the sanctity of life transcends politics. President Trump will stand up against Biden-Harris, who are the most anti-life presidential ticket ever, even supporting the horrors of late-term abortion and infanticide. Because of his courage and conviction, President Trump has earned the support of America’s pro-life community. Moreover, he has a nationwide of religions standing behind him. You’ll find us here with our weapon of choice, the rosary. So thank you Mr. President. We are all praying for you.  Lou Holtz: ( 53:22 ) I’m Lou Holtz. Many of you might know me as Coach Holtz, or maybe that football guy. It is a pleasure, a blessing and an honor for me to explain why I believe that President Trump is a consistent winner, an outstanding leader, and deserves to be re-elected as our president. First, I want you to know that I grew up in a one bedroom house in West Virginia. I may have been poor, but the lessons my parents taught me were priceless. They taught me that life is about making choices. Wherever you are, good or bad, don’t blame anyone else, go get an education, get to work. You can overcome any obstacles and always remember that in this great country of ours, anyone can amount to something special. I lived by those principles of hard work and responsibility my whole life, living out the American story, and it works.  Lou Holtz: ( 54:24 ) But there are people today, like politicians, professors, protestors, and of course President Trump’s naysayers in the media who like to blame others. They don’t have pride in our country and because they no longer ask what can I do for my country, only what the country should be doing for them. They don’t have pride in themselves. That’s wrong. When I was an officer in the army, I served with so many great Americans who embraced their responsibility to our country. I’m so proud of their sacrifices and the opportunity this provided for so many millions. America remains the land of opportunity, no matter what the other side says or believes. There’s a statue of me at Notre Dame. I guess they needed a place for the pigeons land, but if you look closely, you will see these three words there, trust, commitment, and love. All my life, I’ve made my choices based on these three words. I use these three rules to make choices about everything, my beloved wife of 59 years, athletes I coached, and of course, politicians, even President Trump. I ask myself three things, one, can I trust them? When a leader tells you something, you got to be able to count on it. That’s President Trump. He says what he means, he means what he say and he’s done what he said he would do at every single turn. One of the important reasons he has my trust is because nobody has been a stronger advocate for the unborn than President Trump. The Biden-Harris ticket is the most radically pro-abortion campaign in history. They and other politicians are Catholics in name only and abandoned innocent lives. President Trump protects those lives. I trust President Trump.  Lou Holtz: ( 56:36 ) The second question I ask is are they committed to doing their very best. President Trump always finds a way to get something done. If you want to do something bad enough, you’ll find a way. If not, you’ll find an excuse and excuses are a lot easier to find than solutions. President Trump finds solutions. President Trump is committed. A third question I ask is do they love people. Do they care about others? To me this is very clear. President Trump has demonstrated through his prison reform, advocating for school choice, and welfare reform that he wants Americans from all walks of life to have the opportunity to succeed and live the American dream. President Trump loves our country and our great people. Trust, commitment, and love. In President Trump we have a president we can trust, who works hard at making America greater and who genuinely cares about people. I  Lou Holtz: ( 57:46 ) If I apply this test to Joe Biden, I can’t say yes to any of these three questions. I used to ask our athletes at Notre Dame, “If you did not show up, who would miss you and why?” Can you imagine what would happen to us if President Trump had not shown up in 2016 to run for president? I’m so glad he showed up. Thank you for showing up, Mr. President. I encourage everyone who loves this country, who loves America, to show up in November, for President Trump. Thank you.  Michael McHale: ( 58:31 ) Hi. I’m Michael McHale but my friends call me Mick. I’m a 30-year active duty member of law enforcement in the state of Florida. I am also the president of the National Association of Police Organizations, NAPO. Our organization recently endorsed Donald Trump for re-election as President of the United States. Our endorsement recognized his strong support for the men and women on the frontlines, particularly during these challenging times. We value his support of aggressive federal prosecution of those who attack our police officers. His signing of the Law Enforcement Mental Health and Wellness Act and his support for permanently authorizing funds to support 911 first responders and their families.  Michael McHale: ( 59:27 ) Law enforcement officers across the nation take an oath to run towards danger when everyone else is running away. They do so willingly to protect our families and communities. I’m proud that the overwhelming majority of American police officers are the best of the best and put their lives on the line without hesitation, and good officers need to know their elected leaders and the department brass have their backs.  Michael McHale: ( 59:58 ) Unfortunately, chaos results when failed officials in cities like Portland, Minneapolis, Chicago and New York make the conscious decision not to support law enforcement. Shootings, murders, looting and rioting occur unabated. The violence and bloodshed we are seeing in these and other cities isn’t happening by chance. It’s the direct result of refusing to allow law enforcement to protect our communities. Joe Biden has turned his candidacy over to the far left, anti-law enforcement radicals, and as a senator, Kamala Harris pushed to further restrict police, cut their training, and make our American communities and streets even more dangerous than they already are. Conversely, President Trump supports the creation of a national standard for training on de-escalation and communication to give officers more tools to resolve conflict without violence.  Michael McHale: ( 01:01:12 ) The differences between Trump-Pence and Biden-Harris are crystal clear. Your choices are the most pro-law enforcement president we’ve ever had or the most radical anti-police ticket in history. We invite those who value the safety of their family and loved ones to join the hundreds of thousands of members of the National Association of Police Organizations and support the re-election of President Donald J. Trump. Thank you and God bless America.  Elise Stefanik: ( 01:02:08 ) I’m Congresswoman Elise Stefanik and I am honored to represent New York’s 21st Congressional District, the cradle of the American revolution. It’s where almost 250 years ago, brave patriots fought in the Battles of Saratoga to turn the tide of the Revolutionary War. It’s where 40 years ago in Lake Placid a team of amateur hockey players out-hustled, out-skated and defeated the Soviet Union, stunning the world and giving us the unforgettable Miracle on Ice, and today, it’s home to Fort Drum and the historic 10th Mountain Division, the most deployed unit in the U.S. Army since 9/11, where I saw firsthand President Trump graciously thank and honor our men and women in uniform and sign the largest pay raise for our troops in a decade. Since our nation’s founding, generation after generation of everyday Americans served and sacrificed to preserve and strengthen the American dream. The vision of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness and the idea that if you work hard and dream big, you can achieve anything you imagine. I believe in the American dream because I’ve lived it. Like millions of Americans, I grew up in a small business family where I learned the values of hard work and determination. I was the first person in my immediate family to graduate from college, ran for Congress to serve Upstate New York, and am proudly the youngest Republican woman elected to Congress in history. I am honored to support President Trump for re-election because I know that he is the only candidate who will stand up for hardworking families and protect the American dream for future generations. Since his first day in office, President Trump has fought tirelessly to deliver results for all Americans, despite the Democrats’ baseless and illegal impeachment sham and the media’s endless obsession with it. I was proud to lead the effort standing up for the Constitution, President Trump, and most importantly, the American people.  Elise Stefanik: ( 01:04:26 ) This attack was not just on the president. It was an attack on you, your voice and your vote, but the American people were not swayed by these partisan attacks. Our support for President Trump is stronger than ever before. We know what’s at stake in this historic election. Americans from all walks of life are unified in support of our president. It’s why more Republican women than ever are running for office this year. We understand that this election is a choice between the far left Democratic socialist agenda versus protecting and preserving the American dream. President Trump is working to safely reopen our main street economy. He understands that the engine of our country is fueled by the ingenuity and determination of American workers, entrepreneurs, and small businesses. Joe Biden wants to keep them locked up in the basement and crush them with $4 trillion in new taxes. We face a critical choice. Joe Biden’s far left failed policies of the past 47 years, or President Trump who will stand up for the American people and the Constitution. I believe in the wisdom and spirit of the American people to elect the only candidate who is capable of protecting the American dream, President Donald J. Trump. Thank you to the North Country for the opportunity to serve as your voice supporting his re-election. God bless the United States of America, the greatest country on earth.  Madison Cawthorn: ( 01:06:19 ) Good evening. I’m Madison Cawthorn and I’m running to represent North Carolina’s 11th Congressional District. This is a time of great adversity for our country and I know something about adversity. At 18 years old, I was in a horrific car accident that’s left me paralyzed from the waist down. Instantly, my hopes and dreams were seemingly destroyed. I was given a 1% chance of surviving but thanks to the power of prayer, a very loving community and many skilled doctors, I made it. It took me over a year to recover. My first public outing in a wheelchair was to a professional baseball game. Before my accident I was 6’3″, I stood out in a crowd, but as I wheeled through the stadium, I felt invisible. At 20, I thought about giving up. However, I knew I could still make a difference and my accident has given me new eyes to see and new ears to hear. God protected my mind and my ability to speak, so I say to people who feel forgotten, ignored and invisible, I see you. I hear you.  Madison Cawthorn: ( 01:07:29 ) At 20, I made a choice. In 2020 our country has a choice. We can give up on the American ideal or we can work together to make our imperfect union more perfect. I choose to fight for the future, to seize the high ground and retake the shining city on a hill. While the radical left wants to dismantle, defund and destroy, Republicans, under President Trump’s leadership want to rebuild, restore and renew. I just turned 25. When I’m elected this November, I’ll be the youngest member of Congress in over –  Madison Cawthorn: ( 01:08:03 ) When I’m elected this November, I’ll be the youngest member of Congress in over 200 years. And if you don’t think young people can change the world, then you just don’t know american history. George Washington was 21 when he received his first military commission. Abe Lincoln, 22 when he first ran for office. And my personal favorite, James Madison was just 25 years old when he signed the Declaration of Independence. In times of peril, young people have stepped up and saved this country abroad and at home. We held the line, scaled the cliffs, crossed oceans, liberated camps and cracked codes. Yet today, political forces want to usher in the digital dark ages, a time of information without wisdom, and tribalism without truth. National leaders on the left have normalized emotion-based voting and a radicalized identity politics that rejects Martin Luther King’s dream. MLK’s dream is our dream, for all Americans to be judged solely on their character. Millions of people risk their lives every year to come here because they believe in the dream of MLK and the American dream.  Madison Cawthorn: ( 01:09:13 ) Join us as we, the party of freedom, double down on ensuring the American dream for all people. We are committed to building a new town square. It welcomes all ideas and all people. Here, we will have freedom of speech, not freedom from speech. To liberals, I say, “Let’s have a conversation. Be a true liberal, listen to other ideas and let the best ones prevail.” And to Conservatives, I say, “Let’s define what we support and win the argument in areas like healthcare and on the environment.” In this new town square, you don’t have to apologize for your beliefs or cower to a mob. You can kneel before God, but stand for our flag. The American idea my ancestors fought for during the revolutionary war is just as exciting and revolutionary today as it was 250 years ago. I say to Americans who love our country, young and old, “Be a radical for freedom, be a radical for liberty and be a radical for our republic for which I stand. One nation under God with liberty and justice for all.”  Madison Cawthorn: ( 01:10:26 ) Thank you, and may God bless America.  Jack Pruitt: ( 01:10:49 ) I’m Jack Pruitt, a former three time NFL team captain, college professor, coach, husband, son, and father. I’m also a lifelong Democrat, but I support Donald Trump. Let me be clear, I didn’t come here for the popularity or the praise, the likes or the retweets. I’m here as a servant to God, a servant to the people of our nation and a servant to our president. I grew up in Grapevine, Texas, a town that my great grandfather was the first black man to settle as a sharecropper in 1896. My early high school experience included fighting with skinheads and being a witness in an attempted murder trial, after my friend shot a skinhead in self defense. I remember my dad’s bravery when he personally stood up against a KKK rally in my town. In my house, my father taught me to back down from no one. I know what racism looks like, I’ve seen it firsthand. In America, it has no resemblance to president Trump and I’m fed up with the way he’s portrayed in the media, who refuse to acknowledge what he’s actually done for the black community. It’s confusing the minds of our innocent children.  Jack Pruitt: ( 01:12:05 ) Before I left to come deliver this message, my energetic eight year old son, Jackson, stopped me and said, “Dad, can you please just tell everyone that all lives need to matter and that God loves everyone?” In that moment, I realized that my eight year old had figured out what so many adults have seemed to forget, we are not as divided as our politics suggests. At some point, for the sake of our children, the policies must take priority over the personalities. So, because you have an issue with president Trump’s tone, you’re going to allow Biden and Harris to deny our underserved black and brown children school choice? Are we so offended by the president’s campaign slogan, Make America Great Again, that we’re going to ignore that Joe Biden and Kamala Harris have collectively been responsible for locking up countless black men for nonviolent crimes?  Jack Pruitt: ( 01:13:03 ) Are you going to allow the media to lie to you by falsely claiming that he said there were very fine white supremacists in Charlottesville. He didn’t say that, it’s a lie. And ignore the so called Black Lives Matter organization that openly on their website called for the destruction of the nuclear family. My fellow Americans, our families need each other. We need black fathers in the homes with their wives in children. The future of our communities depend on it. I’m blessed to be able to run inner city youth programs and to also teach in prisons across America. The inmates in my federal prison program literally received days off their sentence just for attending my class, and that’s thanks to president Donald Trump in his First Step Act. President Trump cared about these Americans and their families, even when so many others had left them behind and had written them off.  Jack Pruitt: ( 01:14:02 ) I’m forever grateful for president Trump for that. He endures relentless attacks, and so do many of us like myself who support him. But my momma always told me, “When the Lord starts blessing, the devil starts messing.” This convention marks a time to celebrate our history. Republicans are the party that freed the slaves and the party that put the first black men and women in Congress. It’s the party of Frederick Douglas and Abraham Lincoln, and now Tim Scott and Donald Trump. Our president has made incredible strides to end mass incarceration and give unprecedented opportunities for blacks in America to rise. America, let this election be a call for all God’s people who are called by his name to humble ourselves and pray together and to seek his face to return from our wicked ways. Then, he will hear us from heaven and he will forgive our sins and he will heal our land. Amen, and God bless America.  Chen Guangcheng: ( 01:15:37 ) Greetings. My name is Chen Guangcheng. Standing up to tyranny is not easy, I know. When I spoke out against China’s One Child Policy and other injustices, I was prosecuted, beaten, sent to prison and put under house arrest by the Chinese Communist Party, the CCP. In April, 2012, I escaped and was given shelter in the American embassy in Beijing. I’m forever grateful to the American people for welcome me and my family to the United States, where we are now free. The CCP is an enemy of humanity. It is terrorizing its own people and it is threatening the wellbeing of the world. In China, expressing beliefs or ideas not approved by the CCP, religion, democracy, human rights, can lead to prison. The nation lives under mass surveillance and censorship. The US must use its values of freedom, democracy, and the rule of law to gather a coalition of other democracies to stop CCP’s aggression. President Trump had led on these and we need the other countries to join him in this fight, a fight for our future. Standing up to fight unfairness isn’t easy, I know. So does president Trump, but he has shown the courage to win that fight. We need to support, vote and fight for president Trump, for the sake of the world. Thank you.  Lee Zeldin: ( 01:18:29 ) I’m Congressman Lee Zeldin. Tonight, as we celebrate America as a land of heroes, I’m here at a VFW post of heroes in West Hamptonbeach, New York. I’ve seen amazing Americans in action. Raised in a law enforcement family, deployed to Iraq as an 82nd airborne paratrooper and serving today in the army reserve, my generation of post 9/11 veterans has huge shoes to fill, following our greatest generation that fought tyranny and saved the world. All over our country, every day heroes serve and sacrifice for the greater good. Farmers, truckers, craftsmen. These heroes keep America running and president Trump fights for them every day. This year, we’ve especially relied on one particular group of heroes, frontline medical workers. My twin daughters, McKayla and Ariana, were born over 14 weeks early. They weighed just a pound and a half. At two weeks, McKayla went into septic shock, had a stroke and underwent brain surgery, leaving a third of the left side of her brain a hole.  Lee Zeldin: ( 01:19:47 ) Her doctors didn’t believe McKayla would survive, fearing dire, permanent consequences even if she did. Through the miracles of modern medicine, power of prayer and her will to live, my daughters are now starting high school and doing great, with no longterm effects from those frightful months in the NICU. So, when I learned my county’s PPE stockpile was depleted, I immediately thought of those healthcare workers who saved my baby girls. Jerry Kushner and I were on the phone late into that Saturday night. The very next day, president Trump announced he was sending us 200,000 N95 masks. He actually delivered almost 400,000. That number quickly grew to 1.2 million masks, gowns and more. The president sent thousands of ventilators to New York, he deployed the USS Comfort and converted the Javits Center to a field hospital. His administration authorized our lab testing requests at blinding speed. During a once in a century pandemic, an unforeseeable crisis sent to us from a far away land, the president’s effort for New York was phenomenal.  Lee Zeldin: ( 01:21:07 ) For our nation to emerge even stronger, more prosperous, freer and more secure than ever, to make our country greater than ever before, we must reelect president Trump. We are the land of the free because of the brave, and we are the land of opportunity because we have a president who wants to empower the best of who we are to be the best of what we can be. There’s never been a nation greater than ours, never a people more resilient than ours and never a future for America more promising than ours right now. Keeping America great is up to us and losing is not an option.  Ralph Case: ( 01:21:59 ) And I’m very proud to have president Trump in office here, since he’s the best we’ve ever had. He’s done the most for any president ever has done.  Tim Woods: ( 01:22:08 ) He’s always there, trying to take care of veterans, giving veterans what they need. And the turnaround times have increased since Trump has taken over, you had to fight 15 years for benefits, but once he came to office you had 90 days, you turned your paperwork in, at least you had some answer.  Mike Verardo: ( 01:22:24 ) I waited months for a signature on a piece of paper to get a prosthetic leg fixed. Now, it’s a lot better turnaround.  Tim Woods: ( 01:22:31 ) But before it was five-year waiting process to appeal. So, how long do we have to wait for benefits?  Brian Ballard: ( 01:22:38 ) I waited 20 years to file. Rapidly was approved for medical and then turned right around and got disability. I was thinking it was going to be a several years worth of waiting to hear.  Ed Clayton: ( 01:22:51 ) He’s accomplished a lot in three and a half years, and it helps the American people. And he has done a lot for veterans, for the middle class.  Tim Woods: ( 01:22:59 ) I chose to serve my country. If I could do it, I would do it all over again. Especially for this president, he’s the kind of president you’d run through a brick wall if he asked you to.  Ralph Case: ( 01:23:09 ) Went through many presidents, but this one I can say is the best president we’ve ever had and ever will have, I believe.  Joni Ernst: ( 01:23:28 ) Hello everyone, and thank you for inviting me into your home this evening. It’s truly a privilege. My name is Joni Ernst, I was raised on a small family farm here in Iowa, where I learned the importance of faith, hard work and service. I worked my way through college, then dedicated my life to serving my country as a local official, a battalion commander in the military, and as a US Senator. Service, it’s more than a word to me. It’s a mission, a way of life, it’s what brought me to Cedar Rapids Iowa in 2008, when I was in the National Guard. We saw historic floods that swept through the communities. We lent a helping hand to our fellow Iowans who were literally underwater. We thought we had seen the worst, but 12 years later these same communities have faced an even more devastating disaster, the recent derecho storm. If you don’t live in Iowa, you may not have heard much about it at first. While reporters here in the state were in the trenches, covering the equivalent of a category two hurricane, most of the national media looked the other way. To them, Iowa’s still just fly-over country.  Joni Ernst: ( 01:24:49 ) House, farms were destroyed. About one third of our crops here were damaged. In some cases, these storms wiped out a lifetime of work, and yet Iowa farmers didn’t hesitate to grab their chainsaws and check on their neighbors. Our farmers live every day with that sense of service. The stewards of the land, the ones who feed and fuel the world. President Trump quickly signed an emergency declaration for Iowa to provide relief. And of course, when president Trump came to Cedar Rapids, the national media finally did too.  Joni Ernst: ( 01:25:29 ) For years, I’ve worked closely with the president, for farmers in Iowa and across the country. We scrapped Obama and Biden’s punishing Waters of the United States Rule, which would have regulated about 97% of land in Iowa. In some cases, even puddles. It would have been a nightmare for farmers. The president delivered on major trade deals with Japan and the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement. And he implemented the sale of E15 fuel year round. That means more choices for you at the pump and more jobs for farmers in the heartland. This is something the Obama Biden administration failed to do in eight years. In fact, I can’t recall an administration more hostile to farmers than Obama/Biden, unless you count the Biden/Harris ticket. The democratic party of Joe Biden is pushing this so-called Green New Deal. If given power, they would essentially ban animal agriculture and eliminate gas powered cars. It would destroy the agriculture industry not just here in Iowa, but throughout the country.  Joni Ernst: ( 01:26:43 ) When the pandemic hit, president Trump heard us in our call for assistance for our farmers. Knowing we have an ally in the white house is important. Folks, this election is a choice between two very different paths. Freedom, prosperity, and economic growth under a Trump/Pence administration or the Biden/Harris path, paved by liberal coastal elites and radical environmentalist. An America where farmers are punished, jobs are destroyed and taxes crush the middle class. That is our choice, and it’s a clear one. Thank you and God bless.  Burgess Owens: ( 01:27:33 ) Ladies and gentlemen, I’m Burgess Owens. Shackled in the belly of a slave ship, an eight year old boy named Sals Burgess came to America to be sold on an auction block. By the grace of God and the courage of slaves who believed in freedom, Sals escape through the underground railroad and settled in the great state of Texas. He wanted to become a successful entrepreneur. He built his community’s first church, first elementary school, and purchased 102 acres of farmland, which he paid off in two years. I’m here today, a candidate for Congress, because of my great great grandfather Sals Burgess. I was raised in the South during the days of Jim Crow and the KKK. Even through the challenges of segregation, we were taught that anything is possible in America. When I was 22 years old, I thought all my dreams had come true when I was drafted by the New York Jets. 10 years later, with a Pro Bowl nod and a Super Bowl championship under my belt, I left the NFL to start a business.  Burgess Owens: ( 01:28:35 ) I thought I could never fail, but years later I did and I lost everything. As I moved my family of six into a one bedroom basement apartment in Brooklyn, New York, I had a choice. To feel sorry for myself or get to work. I worked as a chimney sweep during the day and a security guard at night. It was humbling to be recognized cleaning a chimney by someone who has cheered me as an NFL fan. But those hard days would pay off, and eventually I started a rewarding career in the corporate world. We live in a country where we’re encouraged to dream big, where second chances are at the core of our American DNA. We don’t hear that same message from Nancy Pelosi’s Congress. Career politicians, elitists, and even a former bartender want us to believe it’s impossible. They want us to believe that what I did, what my great great grandfather did, is impossible for ordinary Americans. As Patriots, we know better.  Burgess Owens: ( 01:29:33 ) This November, we stand at a crossroad. Mobs torch our cities while popular members of Congress promote the same socialism that my father fought against in World War II. We have a Democratic candidate for president who says that I’m not black if I don’t vote for him. Now more than ever, we need leaders who stand by their principles, they won’t compromise their values for political opportunities. Now more than ever, we need leaders who will stand up to the lawlessness supported by the radical left. This November, we have an opportunity to reject the mob mentality and once again be the America that my great great grandfather believed in. During the Trump administration, business ownership among blacks, Hispanics, and females have reached all time highs. Those same groups enjoyed record low unemployment and unprecedented prosperity, and we’re just getting started. I ran for Congress because we don’t need more career politicians, we need a few more chimney sweeps. We need more leaders like president Trump, who understand the freedoms that make up the fabric of America. My fellow Americans, specifically my Democrat and Independent friends, it is now time for us to unite and put aside partisan barriers. Help us win back the House, keep the Senate and give our president four more years, and I promise you we will make you proud. Thank you, and God bless the United States of America.  Sam Vigil: ( 01:31:08 ) Standing guard over Baltimore Harbor is the remains of an earthen star, a relic of time passed. It recalls a time when the spirit of Liberty stirred in men of renown, who stood in the gap against the most powerful force in the world. 27 hours, 1000 men, low on ammunition, firing scrap metal. The battle raged, insurmountable odds, a darkness fell upon this new nation. In the midst of the fight, the heroes of Fort McHenry were unmoved. The light of dawn overcame the darkness, the gallon flag hoisted above Fort McHenry, torn and battered stood, victoriously observing a dejected enemy slowly retreating into the rising sun, inspiring the anthem of our nation. The spirit of liberty, not to be denied, the earthen star, Fort McHenry. A reminder of those brave patriots who having done all, stood and prevailed. It is why we stand today honoring past, present and future generations of freedom loving Americans when we hear the Anthem, and raise the Star-Spangled Banner.  Madison Cawthorn: ( 01:32:41 ) Good evening, America. I’m Lara Trump, daughter of Bob and Linda UNESCA, sister to Kyle, mother to Luke and Carolina and the daughter in law of our 45th president, Donald J. Trump. But tonight, I come to you simply as an American. My life began like many in our country. I grew up in Wrightsville Beach, North Carolina. My parents were small business owners and worked hard to make sure that my brother and I had everything we needed, but not everything we wanted. My parents raised me to believe that in America, I could achieve anything with hard work and determination, that the opportunities available to me were limited only by the size of my ambition, that I should dream big. And I did. Those very dreams are what led me to New York City. I’d heard the adage, “If I can make it there, I can make it anywhere.” And I intended to do just that. Never in a million years did I think that I would be on this stage tonight, and I certainly never thought that I’d end up with the last name Trump.  Madison Cawthorn: ( 01:33:46 ) My seventh grade English teacher, Mrs. B used to tell us, “Believe none of what you hear, half of what you read and only what you’re there to witness firsthand.” The meaning of those words never fully weighed on me until I met my husband and the Trump family. Any preconceived notion I had of this family disappeared immediately. They were warm and caring, they were hard workers and they were down to earth. They reminded me of my own family. They made me feel like I was home. Walking the halls of the Trump organization, I saw the same family environment. I also saw the countless women executives who thrived there year after year. Gender didn’t matter, what mattered was the ability to get the job done. I learned this directly when, in 2016, my father-in-law asked me to help him win my cherished home state and my daughter’s namesake, North Carolina. Though I had no political experience, he believed in me. He knew I was capable, even if I didn’t.  Madison Cawthorn: ( 01:34:51 ) So, it didn’t surprise me when president Donald Trump appointed so many women to senior level positions in his administration. Secretary of the United Nations, secretary of the Air Force, the first female CIA director, the first black female director of the Fish and Wildlife Service and countless ambassadors, just to name a few. Under president Trump’s leadership, women’s unemployment hit the lowest level since World War II. 4.3 million new jobs have been created for women. In 2019 alone, women took over 70% of all new jobs. Female small business ownership remains at an all time high and 600,000 women have been lifted out of poverty, all since president Trump took office. He didn’t do these things to gain a vote or check a box. He did them because they’re the right things to do.  Madison Cawthorn: ( 01:35:45 ) 100 years ago today, the 19th Amendment was ratified, granting the right to vote to every American woman. And since that day, incredible strides have been made by women in America. From Amelia Earhart to Rosa Parks and Sally Ride, women shaped our history and are part of what has made our country the most exceptional nation in the world. I often think back to my 24 year old self, driving alone in my car from North Carolina to New York City. And I think about what I’d tell myself now, as we head towards the most critical election in modern history. This is not just a choice between Republican and Democrat or left and right, this is an election that will decide if we keep America America, or if we head down an uncharted frightening path towards socialism.  Madison Cawthorn: ( 01:36:38 ) Abraham Lincoln once famously said, “America will never be destroyed from the outside. If we falter and lose our freedoms, it will be because we destroy it ourselves.” While those words were spoken over 150 years ago, never have they been more relevant. Will we choose the right path and maintain the unique freedoms and boundless opportunities that make this country the greatest in the history of the world? Will we remain the beacon of hope for those around the world fighting oppression, communism, and tyranny? The choice is ours. I know the promise of America because I’ve lived it. Not just as a member of the Trump family, but as a woman who knows what it’s like to work in blue collar jobs, to serve customers for tips and to aspire to rise. When I look at my son, Luke, and my daughter, Carolina, I wonder what sort of country will I be leaving for them, for our future generations? In recent months, we’ve seen weak spineless politicians seek control our great American cities to violent mobs.  Madison Cawthorn: ( 01:37:44 ) “Defund The Police,” is the rallying cry for the new radical Democrat Party. Joe Biden will not do what it takes to maintain order, to keep our children safe in our neighborhoods and in their schools, to restore our American way of life. We cannot dare to dream our biggest dreams for ourselves or for our children while consumed by worry about the safety of our families. President Trump is the law and order president, from our borders to our backyards. President Trump will keep America safe, president Trump will keep America prosperous, president Trump will keep America America. If you’re watching tonight and wrestling with your vote on November 3rd, I implore you, tune out the distorted news and biased commentary and hear it straight from someone who knows. I wasn’t born at Trump, I’m from the South. I was raised a Carolina girl. I went to public schools and worked my way through a state university.  Madison Cawthorn: ( 01:38:47 ) Mrs. B from my seventh grade English class was right, what I learned about our president is different than what you might have heard. I learned that he’s a good man, that he loves his family, that he didn’t need this job, that no one on earth works harder for the American people, that he’s willing to fight for his beliefs and for the people and the country that he loves. He is a person of conviction, he is a fighter and will never stop fighting for America. He will uphold our values, he will preserve our families and he will build upon the great American edict that our union will never be perfect until opportunity is equal for all, including and especially for women. Our 40th president, Ronald Reagan, said it best. “The dreams of people may differ, but everybody wants their dreams to come true and America above all places gives us the freedom to do that. It’s up to us to keep this country a place where no dream is out of reach for our children and generations beyond.”  Madison Cawthorn: ( 01:39:56 ) To my father-in-law, thank you for believing in me. Thank you for bravely leading this country and thank you for continuing to fight every day for America. May God bless and protect the Gulf states in the path of the hurricane, may God bless our troops and may God continue to bless this incredible country.  Sam Vigil: ( 01:40:17 ) Good evening. My name is Sam Vigil. There is a hole in my heart since my beloved was taken from me, this is her story. There were two things that Jackie loved to do every day, one was to go to the gym and tweet out Bible verses and prayers to her friends. On November 19th, the tweets stopped. That day started out like any other day, she left for the gym early in the morning, I heard the garage door open. Seconds later, I heard the car horn. I went outside to see if she had forgotten something. What I saw was a Jeep blocking her car in the driveway. I noticed the bullet hole in Jackie’s window. I saw someone jumping into the Jeep and speeding away. Jackie had just been shot and killed in cold blood. We think this was a carjacking gone very wrong. Every time I open the garage door or stand in the driveway, I hear that horn. I see her slumped in the seat. When I go to bed at night, that sound and image haunt me. That’s my life sentence. It’s a sentence being served by too many families left behind by senseless killings. Albuquerque, where I live, is one of the most violent cities in the country. Fewer than 50% of homicides are solved. It is a sad irony that Jackie immigrated-  Speaker 8: ( 01:42:03 ) It is a sad irony that Jackie immigrated to the US for a better life than her native Columbia, only to be gunned down in her own driveway. For eight months, there were no arrests, no leads in connection with Jackie’s murder. The Albuquerque Police were overwhelmed. They needed help. Help arrived when President Trump launched Operation Legend in July of this year. Almost immediately, the FBI took over Jackie’s case. In a matter of days, they arrested four people. The fifth suspect killer was arrested in Texas on unrelated charges. He is an illegal immigrant with a long criminal record.  Speaker 8: ( 01:42:46 ) He had been deported in September and had come back in October to terrorize our community. I am extremely grateful to President Trump and the FBI for their efforts to deliver justice for Jackie and all of the other innocent victims of violent crime. I am honored to support the President because he is supporting us. I know he will never stop fighting for justice, for law and order, for peace, security in our communities.  Clarence Henderson: ( 01:43:18 ) Greetings my fellow Americans. I am Clarence Henderson. There have been movements that have changed the course of history. Among the most extraordinary was the Civil Rights movement. 60 years ago, segregation was legal and enforced. The simple act of sitting at a lunch counter could lead to physical harm, jail time, or worse. I know from personal experience walking into Woolworth Department Store on February 2nd, 1960, I knew it was unlike any day I had experienced before. My friends had been denied service the day before because of the color of their skin. We knew it wasn’t right, but when we went back the next day, I didn’t know whether I was going to come out in a vertical or prone position in handcuffs, or on a stretcher, or even in a body bag. By sitting down to order a cup of coffee, we challenged injustice.  Clarence Henderson: ( 01:44:23 ) We knew it was necessary, but we didn’t know what would happen. We faced down the KKK. We were cursed at and called all kinds of names. They threatened to kill us and some of us were arrested, but it was worth it. Our actions inspired similar protests throughout the South against racial injustice. In the end, segregation was abolished and our country moved a stepped closer to true equality for all. That’s what actual peaceful protest can accomplish. America isn’t perfect. We’re always improving. But the great thing about this country is that it’s not where you come from, it’s where you’re going. I was born on what some would call the wrong side of the tracks. I don’t even have a birth certificate. I never attended an integrated school. I’m the only one out of my immediate family who graduated from college in HBCU. I’m a military veteran and a civil rights activist, and you know what else?  Clarence Henderson: ( 01:45:33 ) I’m a Republican, and I support Donald Trump. If that sounds strange, you don’t know your history. It was the Republican Party that passed the 13th Amendment abolishing slavery. It was the Republican Party that passed the 14th Amendment, giving black men citizenship. It was the Republican Party that passed the 15th Amendment, giving black men the right to vote. Freedom of thought is a powerful thing. There are Americans, voters all over the country who media is trying to convince to conform to the same old democratic talking points. You know what that will get you? The same old results. Joe Biden had the audacity to say, if you don’t vote for him, you ain’t black. Well, to that, I say, if you do vote for Biden, you don’t know history. Donald Trump is not a politician. He’s a leader. Politicians are a dime a dozen, leaders are priceless. The record funding Trump gave HBCUs is priceless, too.  Clarence Henderson: ( 01:46:41 ) So are the record number of jobs he created for the black community and the investment he drove into our neighborhoods with tax incentives and opportunity zones. So are the lives he restored by passing Criminal Justice Reform, where 91% of the inmates released are black. These achievements demonstrate that Donald Trump truly cares about black lives. His policies show his heart. He has done more for black Americans in four years than Joe Biden has done in 50. Donald Trump is offering real and lasting change, an unprecedented opportunity to rise a country that embraces the spirit of the Civil Rights movement of the 60s. A place where people are judged by the content of their character, their talents and abilities, not by the color of their skin. This is the America I was fighting for 60 years ago. This is the America Donald Trump is fighting for today. Let’s all join in this fight for re-electing president Trump on November 3rd. Thank you.  Richard Grenell: ( 01:47:57 ) During the presidential primary debates, four years ago, one outsider stood alone and said in public what most Americans thought in private. It was 14 years after the start of the war in Afghanistan and 12 years after the invasion of Iraq, where thousands of American troops had died and trillions in taxpayer dollars had been spent. Yet, no candidate could bring themselves to admit that something had gone badly wrong with American foreign policy, that the American voter, the American soldier, and the American taxpayer had all been let down, except for one, Donald Trump. He called America’s endless wars what they were, a disaster. The media was shocked because Donald Trump was running as a Republican, and yet, he said out loud what we all knew, that American foreign policy was failing to make Americans safer.  Richard Grenell: ( 01:49:03 ) After the end of the Cold War, Democrats and Republicans in Washington bought into the illusion that the whole world would start to resemble America. So, they started to pursue unlimited globalization. They welcome China into the world trade organization. They engaged in nation building in Afghanistan and tried to export democracy to Iraq. They signed a nuclear deal with Iran and a global climate agreement in Paris, but they didn’t ground any of it in the interest of the average American. So, for decades, while Washington politicians built a global system, American wages stagnated. Our great cities and industries were hollowed out. Entire communities were devastated and our manufacturing plants were shipped off to China. That’s what happened when Washington stopped being the capital of the United States and started being the capital of the world. As US Ambassador to Germany, I had a front row seat to Donald Trump’s America first foreign policy.  Richard Grenell: ( 01:50:14 ) I wish every American could see how President Trump negotiates on their behalf. I’ve watched President Trump charm the Chancellor of Germany while insisting that Germany pay its NATO obligations. I was proud to witness President Trump say to foreign leaders, “I don’t blame you for wanting America to pay for your security. I actually respect you for out negotiating the presidents before me, but it stops with me. I won’t let the American taxpayer be taken advantage of.” Donald Trump’s Administration has always made clear that our priority is the American people’s security. That’s the job of all leaders, to put their people first. We’ve seen how this strategy has succeeded. In four short years, Donald Trump has led even some Washington Democrats to agree on the Chinese threat, on trade deals that benefit America first, on alliances that share responsibility.  Richard Grenell: ( 01:51:19 ) In four years, Donald Trump didn’t start any new wars. He brought troops home. He rebuilt the military and signed peace deals that make Americans safer. The Washington elites want you to think this kind of foreign policy is immoral. So, they call it nationalist. That tells you all you need to know. The DC crowd thinks when they call Donald Trump a nationalist, they’re insulting him. As if the American President isn’t supposed to base foreign policy on America’s national interests. A return to the Biden way of thinking means America gives the radical terrorist regime in Tehran a plane load of cash in the middle of the night. Well, you see, President Trump also sent an aircraft in the middle of the night to deal with Iran, but that plane was on a different mission. An airstrike to take out the head of Iran’s terror machine who plotted the deaths of Americans.  Richard Grenell: ( 01:52:22 ) But we also must be clear that when those who seek freedom take tremendous personal risk in places like Hong Kong, Tehran, or Minsk, there is no doubt who President Trump’s Administration supports. We will always stand with the people who fight for their God given freedoms. Don’t be fooled. The Washington establishment is trying to sell you on their candidate. Joe Biden was first elected to the Senate in 1972, 48 years ago. Well, it’s actually the typical Washington story. Just this year 22 Democrats ran for president. They rejected all of the outsiders and nominated the ultimate Washington insider, someone they had to pull out of retirement. Every time Joe Biden offers a new idea, you should ask yourself, why didn’t he try that over the last 48 years? Today, the Democrats blame a global pandemic that started in China on President Trump. They still blame Russia for Hillary Clinton’s loss in 2016. As Acting Director of National Intelligence, I saw the Democrat’s entire case for Russian collusion.  Richard Grenell: ( 01:53:46 ) What I saw made me sick to my stomach. The Obama-Biden administration secretly launched a surveillance operation on the Trump campaign and silenced the many brave intelligence officials who spoke up against it. They presented bogus information as facts. They lied to judges. Then, they classified anything that undermined their case. After Donald Trump won the election, when they should have continued the American tradition of helping the president elect transition into the White House, they tried instead to undercut him even more. Former Vice President Joe Biden asked intelligence officials to uncover the hidden information on President Trump’s incoming National Security Advisor three weeks before the inauguration. That’s the Democrats. Between surveillance, classifications, leaks, and puppet candidates, they never want the American people to know who’s actually calling the shots.  Richard Grenell: ( 01:54:52 ) But with Donald Trump, you always know exactly who is in charge, because the answer is you. You’re in charge, not lobbyists, not special interests, not warmongers, or China sympathizers, or globalization fanatics. With Donald Trump and Mike Pence in the white house, the boss is the American people. President Trump rightly calls his foreign policy America First. America First does not advance the interests of one group of Americans at the expense of another. It has no bias about red or blue, educated or not educated, urban or rural. America First is simply the belief that politicians should focus on the equality and dignity of every American, and that this duty is fulfilled by promoting the safety and wealth of the American people above all else. That’s America First, that’s the Trump doctrine, and that my friends is four more years.  Narrator: ( 01:56:17 ) By dawn’s early light, millions of Americans give thanks for this land, our liberties, and those who defend it. That same pride inspired the words of our national anthem, penned here as the smoke of battle lifted over two centuries ago. When those American soldiers bravely fought and died, repelling the British on spot, they did so not only for our people, which that flag represented, but for our principles for which the flag stood. Our God-given freedoms, the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. Equality under the law government, by the people. These are the threads that bind us together as Americans, for we are not a nation born of blood, but a belief. Even though that old flag has sometimes been battered and beaten, faded and forgotten, fired upon and set ablaze, there are heroes throughout our history who have picked up those tattered strands, mended them, and raised our flag anew.  Narrator: ( 01:57:25 ) Just as the soldiers at Fort McHenry fought in defense of the beliefs that bind us today, there are new leaders who have devoted their life to do the same.  Mike Pence: ( 01:57:39 ) Greetings across the amber waves of grain, this is Mike Pence.  Narrator: ( 01:57:43 ) Across Indiana highways and homes, his voice warmly welcomed Hoosier’s each morning. Mike Pence filled the radio waves with conservative commentary, guarding our American ideals, but much like the man who inspired him, Mike didn’t grow up a Republican.  Mike Pence: ( 01:58:01 ) As President Reagan said, freedom is never more than one generation away from extinction.  Narrator: ( 01:58:06 ) His grandfather was a hardworking Irish immigrant who drove a bus to provide for his family. His father served our nation bravely in the Korean War and earned a Bronze Star. Mike was the third of six children, raised here in Columbus, Indiana with a cornfield in his backyard.  Mike Pence: ( 01:58:24 ) The foundation of America is freedom, and the foundation of freedom is faith.  Narrator: ( 01:58:30 ) It was in this small Indiana town, his foundation of faith in Jesus Christ was laid. From that conviction sprung his love of people and service to others. It was at a church service where Mike met the love of his life, Karen. They married and have three children, Michael, Charlotte, and Audrey.  Mike Pence: ( 01:58:49 ) I’m a Christian, a Conservative, and a Republican in that order.  Narrator: ( 01:58:54 ) Mike became the president of a free market think tank, the host of a statewide conservative radio show, and then, a Congressman. In Washington, Mike quickly became known as a foremost defender of freedom. He led Conservatives in the fight to protect our time honored values of family, faith, life, liberty, and limited government.  Mike Pence: ( 01:59:16 ) Our nation’s strength begins at home because strong families make a strong America.  Narrator: ( 01:59:21 ) Mike earned the trust of the people of his State and became the 50th Governor of Indiana. He delivered the largest state tax cut in Indiana history, expanded school choice, led the country in manufacturing, and helped more Hoosiers get to work than ever before, but he wasn’t through.  Speaker 9: ( 01:59:40 ) ABC News has learned that Donald Trump will choose Indiana Governor Mike Pence to be his running mate.  Donald Trump: ( 01:59:44 ) I would like to introduce a man who I truly believe will be the next Vice President of the United States. Governor Mike Pence.  Narrator: ( 01:59:55 ) As our Vice President, Mike Pence has held tightly to those threads of freedom woven through our history. Leading with those principles alongside President Trump, our nation experienced prosperity like never before.  Donald Trump: ( 02:00:09 ) He is solid as a rock, he’s been a fantastic Vice President.  Narrator: ( 02:00:14 ) Now, in these uncertain days, we are equipped to overcome. In times of trouble, some call to retreat from those ideals, but Americans throughout history have lifted them in triumph, hope, and resilience. Mike Pence knows those stars and stripes do not merely represent who we are, but more importantly, what we can be. As the sun rises again on America, we lift our eyes to those lofty truths to guide our country and every one of us to greater heights. In this land of the free and home of the brave Vice President Mike Pence.  Speaker 10: ( 02:01:20 ) Please welcome the Vice President of the United States, Mike Pence, accompanied by the Second Lady, Mrs. Karen Pence.  Mike Pence: ( 02:02:30 ) Good evening, America. It’s an honor to speak to you tonight from the hallowed grounds of Fort McHenry. The site of the very battle that inspired the words of our national anthem. Those words have inspired these land of heroes in every generation since. It was on this site, 206 years ago, when our young republic heroically withstood a ferocious naval bombardment from the most powerful empire on earth. They came to crush our revolution, to divide our nation, and to end the American experiment. The heroes who held this Fort took their stand for life, liberty, freedom, and the American flag. Those ideals have defined our nation, but they were hardly ever mentioned at last week’s Democratic National Convention. Instead, Democrats spent four days attacking America.  Mike Pence: ( 02:03:43 ) Joe Biden said that we were living through a season of darkness, but as President Trump said, where Joe Biden sees American darkness, we see American greatness. In these challenging times, our country needs a president who believes in America, who believes in the boundless capacity of the American people to meet any challenge, defeat any foe, and defend the freedoms we hold dear. America needs four more years of President Donald Trump in the White House. Before I go further, allow me to say a word to the families and communities in the path of Hurricane Laura. Our prayers are with you tonight. Our administration is working closely with authorities in the States that will be impacted. FEMA has mobilized resources and supplies for those in harm’s way.  Mike Pence: ( 02:04:54 ) This is a serious storm, and we urge all those in the affected areas to heed State and local authorities. Stay safe and know that we’ll be with you every step of the way to support, rescue, respond, and recover in the days and weeks ahead. That’s what Americans do. Four years ago, I answered the call to join this ticket because I knew that Donald Trump had the leadership and the vision to make America great again. For the last four years, I’ve watched this President endure unrelenting attacks, but get up every day and fight to keep the promises that he made to the American people. So, with gratitude for the confidence President Donald Trump has placed in me, the support of our Republican Party, and the grace of God, I humbly accept your nomination to run and serve as Vice President of the United States. Serving the American people in this office has been a journey. I never expected. It’s a journey that would not have been possible without the support of my family. Beginning with my wonderful wife, Karen. She’s a lifelong school teacher, an incredible mother to our three children, and she is one outstanding Second Lady of the United States. I’m so proud of you. We couldn’t be more proud of our three children, Marine Corps Captain Michael J. Pence and his wife, Sarah. Our daughter, Charlotte Pence Bond, an author, and the wife to Lieutenant Henry Bond who is currently deployed and serving our nation in the United States Navy. Our youngest, a recent law school grad, our daughter Audrey and her fiance who like so many other Americans had to delay their wedding this summer. But we can’t wait for Dan to be a part of our family. In addition to my wife and kids, the person who shaped my life the most is also with us tonight. My mom, Nancy. She is the daughter of an Irish immigrant, 87 years young, and mom follows politics very closely. The truth be told, sometimes I think I’m actually her second favorite candidate on the Trump-Pence ticket. Thank you, mom. I love you. Over the past four years, I’ve had the privilege to work closely with our President. I’ve seen him when the cameras are off. Americans see President Trump in lots of different ways, but there’s no doubt how President Trump sees America. He sees America for what it is, a nation that has done more good in this world than any other, a nation that deserves far more gratitude than grievance. If you want a President who falls silent when our heritage is demeaned or insulted, he’s not your man. Now, we came by very different routes to this partnership, and some people think we’re a little bit different. I’ve learned a few things watching him, watching him deal with all that we’ve been through over the past four years, he does things in his own way, on his own terms. Not much gets past him. When he has an opinion, he’s liable to share it. He certainly kept things interesting, but more importantly, President Donald Trump has kept his word to the American people. In a city known for talkers, President Trump is a doer, and few presidents have brought more independence, energy, or determination to that office. Four years ago, we inherited a military hollowed out by devastating budget cuts, an economy struggling to break out of the slowest recovery since the great depression, ISIS controlled a land mass twice the size of Pennsylvania.  Mike Pence: ( 02:10:52 ) We witnessed a steady assault on our most cherished values, freedom of religion, and the right to life. That’s when President Donald Trump stepped in. From day one, he kept his word. We rebuilt our military. This President signed the largest increase in our national defense since the days of Ronald Reagan, and created the first new branch of our armed forces in 70 years, the United States Space Force. With that renewed energy, we also returned American astronauts to space on an American rocket for the first time in nearly 10 years. After years of scandal that robbed our veterans of the care that you earned in the uniform of the United States, President Trump kept his word again. We reformed the VA and Veterans Choice is now available for every veteran in America. Our armed forces and our veterans fill this land of heroes, and many joined us tonight in this historic Fort.  Mike Pence: ( 02:12:22 ) Tonight, we have among us four recipients of the Medal of Honor, six recipients of the Purple Heart, a Gold Star mother of a gallant Navy SEAL, and wounded warriors from SoldierStrong, a group that serves our injured veterans every day. We are honored by your presence and we thank you for your service. With heroes just like these, we defend this nation every day. Under this Commander in Chief, we’ve taken the fight to radical Islamic terrorists on our terms on their soil. Last year, American armed forces took the last inch of ISIS territory, crushed their califate, and took down their leader without one American casualty. I was there when President Trump gave the order to take out the world’s most dangerous terrorist, Iran’s top general will never harm another American because Qasem Soleimani is gone.  Mike Pence: ( 02:14:12 ) My fellow Americans, you deserve to know, Joe Biden criticized President Trump following those decisions, decisions to rid the world of two terrorist leaders. But it’s not surprising because history records that Joe Biden even opposed the operation that took down Osama bin Laden. It’s no wonder that the Secretary of Defense under the Obama-Biden Administration once said that Joe Biden has been, and I quote, “Wrong on nearly every major foreign policy and national security issue over the past four decades.” So, we’ve stood up to our enemies and we’ve stood with our allies. Like when President Trump kept his word and moved the American embassy to Jerusalem, the capital of the State of Israel, setting the stage for the first Arab country to recognize Israel in 26 years.  Mike Pence: ( 02:15:21 ) Closer to home, we appointed more than 200 Conservative judges through our federal courts. We supported the right to life and all the God-given liberties enshrined in our constitution, including the Second Amendment, right to keep and bear arms. When it came to the economy, President Trump kept his word and then some. We passed the largest tax cut and reform in American history. We rolled back more federal red tape than any administration ever had. We unleashed American energy and fought for free and fair trade. In our first three years, businesses, large and small, created more than seven million good-  Mike Pence: ( 02:16:03 ) Businesses large and small created more than seven million good paying jobs, including 500,000 manufacturing jobs all across America. Our country became a net exporter of energy for the first time in 70 years. Unemployment rates for African Americans and Hispanic Americans hit the lowest level ever recorded. And on this 100th anniversary of a woman’s right to vote, I’m proud to report that under president Donald Trump, we achieved the lowest unemployment rate for women in 65 years, and more Americans working than ever before. In our first three years, we built the greatest economy in the world. We made America great again. And then the Coronavirus struck from China. Before the first case of the Coronavirus spread within the United States, the president took unprecedented action and suspended all travel from China, the second largest economy in the world. Now that action saved untold American lives. And I can tell you firsthand, it bought us invaluable time to launch the greatest national mobilization since World War II.  Mike Pence: ( 02:17:36 ) President Trump marshaled the full resources of our federal government from the outset. He directed us to forge a seamless partnership with governors across America, in both political parties. We partnered with private industry to reinvent testing and produce supplies that were distributed to hospitals around the land. Today we’re conducting more than 800,000 tests a day, and we have coordinated the delivery of billions of pieces of personal protective equipment for our amazing doctors, nurses, and healthcare workers. We saw to the manufacture of 100,000 ventilators in a hundred days. And no one who required a ventilator was ever denied a ventilator in the United States. We build hospitals, surged military medical personnel, and enacted an economic rescue package to save 50 million American jobs. As we speak, we’re developing a growing number of treatments known as therapeutics, including convalescent plasma that are saving lives all across America.  Mike Pence: ( 02:19:01 ) Now last week, Joe Biden said that no miracle is coming. Well what Joe doesn’t seem to understand is that America is a nation of miracles. And I’m proud to report that we’re on track to have the world’s first safe, effective Coronavirus vaccine by the end of this year. After all the sacrifice in this year like no other, and all the hardship, we’re finding our way forward again. But tonight, our hearts are with all the families who’ve lost loved ones and have family members still struggling with serious illness. In this country we mourn with those who mourn, we grieve with those who grieve. And this night, I know that millions of Americans will pause and pray for God’s comfort for each of you. A country doesn’t get through such a time unless its people find strength within. The response of doctors, nurses, first responders, farmers, factory workers, truckers, and everyday Americans who put the health and safety of their neighbors first has been nothing short of heroic.  Mike Pence: ( 02:20:47 ) Veronica Sayez put on her scrubs every day, day in and day out went to work in one of New York City’s busiest hospitals. She stayed on the job, put in the long hours until it was done and then, got back in her neighborhood and helped neighbors and friends struggling. Her brother William is a New York City firefighter, and they’re both emblematic of heroes all across this country. They’re with us tonight. And I say to them and to all of you; you have earned the admiration of the American people, and we will always be grateful for your service and care. Thanks to the courage and compassion of the American people, we’re slowing the spread, we’re protecting the vulnerable, and we’re saving lives, and we’re opening up America again. Because of the strong foundation that president Trump poured in our first three years, we’ve already gained back 9.3 million jobs in the last three months alone. And we’re not just opening up America again, we’re opening up America’s schools. And I’m proud to report that my wife Karen, that school teacher I’ve been married to, will be returning to her classroom next week.  Mike Pence: ( 02:22:54 ) And so to all of our heroic teachers, and faculty, and staff, thank you for being there for our kids. We’re going to stay with you every step of the way. In the days ahead as we open up America again, I promise you, we’ll continue to put the health of America first. And as we’ve worked to bring this economy back, we all have a role to play, and we all have a choice to make. On November 3rd, you need to ask yourself, who do you trust to rebuild this economy? A career politician who presided over the slowest economic recovery since the Great Depression, or a proven leader who created the greatest economy in the world? The choice is clear, to bring America all the way back, we need four more years of president Donald Trump in the White House. My fellow Americans, we’re passing through a time of testing, but in the midst of this global pandemic, just as our nation had begun to recover, we’ve seen violence and chaos in the streets of our major cities.  Mike Pence: ( 02:24:33 ) President Trump and I will always support the right of Americans to peaceful protest, but rioting and looting is not peaceful protest. Tearing down statues is not free speech, and those who do so will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. Last week, Joe Biden didn’t say one word about the violence and chaos engulfing cities across this country. So let me be clear. The violence must stop. Whether in Minneapolis, Portland, or Kenosha. Too many heroes have died defending our freedom to see American strike each other down. We will have law and order on the streets of this country for every American of every race and creed and color. President Trump and I know that the men and women that put on the uniform of law enforcement are the best of us. Every day when they walk out their door, they consider our lives more important than their own. People like Dave Patrick Underwood, an officer in the Department of Homeland Security’s Federal Protective Service, who was shot and killed during the riots in Oakland, California.  Mike Pence: ( 02:26:27 ) Dave’s heroism is emblematic of the heroes that serve in blue every day, and we’re privileged tonight to be joined by his sister, Angela. Angela, we say to you, we grieve with your family, and America will never forget or fail to honor Officer Dave Patrick Underwood. The American people know, we don’t have to choose between supporting law enforcement and standing with our African American neighbors to improve the quality of their lives, education, jobs, and safety. And from the first days of this administration, we’ve done both, and we will keep supporting law enforcement and keep supporting our African American and minority communities across this land for four more years. Joe Biden says that America is systemically racist and that law enforcement in America is, and I quote, an implicit bias against minorities. When asked whether he’d support cutting funding of law enforcement, Joe Biden replied, “Yes, absolutely.” Joe Biden would double down on the very policies that are leading to violence in America’s cities. The hard truth is, you won’t be safe in Joe Biden’s America.  Mike Pence: ( 02:28:35 ) Under president Trump, we will always stand with those who stand on the thin blue line, and we’re not going to defund the police, not now, not ever. My fellow Americans we’re passing through a time of testing, but soon we will come to a time for choosing. Joe Biden has referred to himself as a transition candidate, and many were asking, “Transition to what?” But last week, Democrats didn’t talk very much about their agenda and if I were them, I wouldn’t either. I mean, Bernie Sanders did tell his followers that Joe Biden would be the most liberal president in modern times. In fact, he said, and I quote, that many of the ideas he fought for, that just a few years ago were considered radical, are now mainstream in the Democratic Party. At the root of their agenda is the belief that America is driven by envy, not aspiration, that millions of Americans harbor ill will toward our neighbors, instead of loving our neighbors as ourselves.  Mike Pence: ( 02:30:10 ) The radical left believes that the federal government must be involved in every aspect of our lives to correct those American wrongs. They believe the federal government needs to dictate how Americans live, how we should work, how we should raise our children, and in the process deprive our people of freedom, prosperity, and security. Their agenda is based on government control. Our agenda is based on freedom. Where president Trump cut taxes, Joe Biden wants to raise taxes by nearly $4 trillion. Where this president achieved energy independence for the United States, Joe Biden would abolish fossil fuels, and fracking, and impose the regime of climate change regulations that would drastically increase the cost of living for working families. Where we fought for free and fair trade, and this president stood up to China and ended the era of economic surrender, Joe Biden has been a cheerleader for communist China. He wants to repeal all the tariffs that are leveling the playing field for American workers. And he actually criticized president Trump for suspending all travel to China at the outset of this pandemic.  Mike Pence: ( 02:31:38 ) Joe Biden is for open borders, sanctuary cities, free lawyers and healthcare for illegal immigrants. And president Trump, he secured our border and built nearly 300 miles of that border wall. Joe Biden wants to end school choice, and president Trump believes that every parent should have the right to choose where their children go to school regardless of their income or area code. President Trump has stood without apology for the sanctity of human life, every day of this administration. Joe Biden, he supports taxpayer funding of abortion, right up to the moment of birth. When you consider their agenda, it’s clear, Joe Biden would be nothing more than a Trojan horse for the radical left. The choice in this election has never been clearer, and the stakes have never been higher. Last week, Joe Biden said democracy is on the ballot and the truth is, our economic recovery is on the ballot, law and order are on the ballot, but so are things far more fundamental and foundational to our country.  Mike Pence: ( 02:33:12 ) In this election, it’s not so much whether America will be more conservative or more liberal, more Republican or more Democrat. The choice in this election is whether America remains America. It’s whether we will leave to our children and our grandchildren a country grounded in our highest ideals of freedom, free markets, and the unalienable right to life and liberty, or whether we will leave them a country that’s fundamentally transformed into something else. We stand at a crossroads, America. President Trump has set our nation on a path of freedom and opportunity, Joe Biden would set America on a path of socialism and decline. But we’re not going to let it happen. President Donald Trump believes in America, and in the goodness of the American people, the boundless potential of every American to live out their dreams and freedom. And every day, president Trump has been fighting to protect the promise of America. Every day, our president has been fighting to expand the reach of the American dream. Every day, president Donald Trump has been fighting for you, and now it’s our turn to fight for him.  Mike Pence: ( 02:34:56 ) On this night, in the company of heroes, I’m deeply grateful, deeply grateful for the privilege of serving as vice president of this great nation, and to have the opportunity to serve again. I pray to be worthy of it, and I will give that duty all that’s in me. In the year 2020, the American people have had more than our share of challenges, but thankfully, we have a president with the toughness, energy, and resolve to see us through. Those traits actually run in our national character, as the invading force learned on approach to this Fort, in September of 1814, against fierce and sustained bombardment, our young country was defended by heroes, not so different from those who are with us tonight. The enemy was counting on them to quit, but they never did. Fort McHenry held, and when morning came, our flag was still here.  Mike Pence: ( 02:36:26 ) My fellow Americans, we’re going through a time of testing. But if you look through the fog of these challenging times, you will see, our flag is still there today. That star-spangled banner still waves over the land of the free and the home of the brave. From these hallowed grounds, American Patriots in generations gone by did their part to defend freedom. Now it’s our turn. So let’s run the race marked out for us. Let’s fix our eyes on Old Glory and all she represents. Let’s fix our eyes on this land of heroes, and let their courage inspire. And let’s fix our eyes on the author and perfecter of our faith and our freedom, and never forget, that where the spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom. That means freedom always wins. My fellow Americans, thank you for the honor of addressing you tonight, and the opportunity to run and serve again as your vice president. I leave here today inspired, and I leave here today more convinced than ever that we will do in our time as Americans have done throughout our long and storied past. We will defend our freedom, and our way of life. We will reelect our president, and principled Republican leaders across the land, and with president Donald Trump in the White House for four more years, and with God’s help, we will make America great again, again. Thank you, God bless you, and God bless the United States of America.  Speaker 11: ( 02:42:15 ) Here to perform our national anthem, please welcome country music superstar, Trace Adkins.

Speaker 1: ( 00:11 ) Someone once said that America is great because it is good and that if America ceases to be good, it will no longer be great. It is the goodness in Americans that informs the greatness of America.  Speaker 2: ( 00:26 ) I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America.  Speaker 1: ( 00:32 ) The freedom to do what is right and good, for yourself, for family. To reap the blessings of hard work, to accomplish dreams, to live securely, to help others, not by force of government, but by goodness of heart. Where rights are not granted by government or claimed by identities, but are unalienable as members of the human race. Today, America’s greatness is challenged by those with extreme notions. Defunding law enforcement as lawlessness abounds. Hateful rhetoric, telling you what to wear and when you can work. Limiting free speech and freedom of worship. Old ideas of socialism repackaged in redefined words. Let us restore the values that made America great.  Donald Trump: ( 01:40 ) We will make America strong again.  Speaker 1: ( 01:44 ) Return to the higher standard.  Donald Trump: ( 01:46 ) We will make America proud again.  Speaker 1: ( 01:50 ) The land of freedom of speech, of worship.  Donald Trump: ( 01:53 ) We will make America safe again.  Speaker 1: ( 01:57 ) The land of security and prosperity.  Donald Trump: ( 02:00 ) And we will make America great again.  Speaker 1: ( 02:06 ) A land of greatness.  Speaker 3: ( 02:18 ) From Washington, D.C., welcome to the 2020 Republican National Convention. Tonight, celebrating America as the land of greatness.  Franklin Graham: ( 02:43 ) Let us pray. Our heavenly Father, which art in heaven, we thank you for the great bounty you have bestowed on this nation and the many blessings we have received these past four years. We are forever grateful. As we come tonight, our country is facing trouble. Tens of thousands are in the path of a deadly storm. The pandemic has gripped millions of hearts with fear. We are divided. We have witnessed injustice. Anger and despair have flowed into the streets. We need your help. We need to hear your voice at this crucial hour. We ask that you would unite our hearts to be one nation under God, for you are our only hope. We declare today our total dependence upon you and our need of repentance as a people. I thank you tonight for our president, Donald J. Trump.  Franklin Graham: ( 03:46 ) We pray that you would give him wisdom from on high, clarity of vision, and strength as he leads this nation forward. Bless him. We pray for our First Lady Melania, their son Barron, and all of the family. Protect them and keep them strong and safe. We thank you for Vice President Mike Pence, for his steady hand and clear voice. We pray for Second Lady Karen Pence and their family. Father, we know that you can make this nation great once again if we turn our eyes and our hearts to you and follow your word and obedience. May your will be done on this earth as it is in heaven, and we pray this in the mighty name of your son, my Lord and savior Jesus Christ. Amen.  Madelyn and Jackson Kratzer: ( 04:41 ) I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the republic for which it stands one nation under God indivisible with liberty and justice for all.  Kevin McCarthy: ( 05:08 ) As Americans, we carve our own destiny. As Americans, we look forward, not backward. Our ancestors braved the unknown. They built this nation, brick by brick. They lifted up millions from poverty, hunger, and disease. They vanquished fascism and communism. A great nation because of great people, and no one has done more to protect and advance it than President Trump. As Republicans, we are proud to stand with him and to work for you. Together we built the greatest economy the world has ever seen and we will do it again. We confronted China head-on, tore up bad trade deals and made better ones, supported our men and women in uniform, and took out the world’s top terrorist. Achieved energy independence, defended the sanctity of life, and restored law and order at the border. But as every American knows, we face an invisible enemy that we didn’t ask for nor invite, but we will defeat it. We will defeat it because America is where innovation happens and we are developing a vaccine in record time. We will defeat it because President Trump unleashed a Marshall Plan for Main Street and put hardworking taxpayers back on their feet. We will defeat it because tough times don’t last. Tough Americans do and that is what this election is all about, you, not us.  Kevin McCarthy: ( 06:45 ) Joe Biden and Kamala Harris think this election is about the government. They’re wrong. It’s about your family and your future and to secure what really matters. We will call on the bedrock of what makes us the greatest country in the world, the American promise. A promise that everyone is equal under God, under the Constitution, and under the law. A promise that government is accountable to we the people, a promise that if you work hard and play by the rules, your opportunities are endless. As Republicans, it’s our mission to renew the American dream, restore our way of life, and rebuild the greatest economy in the world. The socialist Democrats have a different agenda. They will dismantle our institutions, defund our police, and destroy our economy. So as you cast your vote this November, remember this. Four years ago, President Trump promised to be your voice. He kept that promise, but there’s still so much more to do. The choice before you could not be clearer. Forward in freedom or backward in socialism. Forward in prosperity, or backward in poverty. Forward in personal liberty, or backwards in more government control. I know which direction I’m headed. Join us as the best is yet to come.  Ja’Ron Smith: ( 08:14 ) Hello. My name is Ja’Ron Smith. 20 years ago, I moved to Washington, D.C. to attend Howard University. I was at a crossroads, just like America is today. I grew up on Strandhill Road in Cleveland, a blue collar street in a blue collar city. When the media talks about forgotten places or working class people who are overlooked and struggling hard, there’s usually some stock photo of people who don’t look like me. They never seem to show people like my mom, who worked two jobs as a gas station clerk and a mom. She showed me how to persevere. They never seem to show people like my dad, who plowed snow in the winter and paved streets in the summer. Who stood by me through thick and thin and taught me strong values every day. They never seem to show people like me.  Ja’Ron Smith: ( 09:45 ) At first, I didn’t live the values my parents taught me. I won a starting spot on the varsity football team but I only had a 1.9 GPA. But then I broke my leg. It took a broken leg for me to really get moving in life. I prioritized schoolwork, went to Howard, and ended up working for the President of the United States. Growing up, I never really known a Republican. I believed all the stereotypes. It took a meeting with Republicans who shared my values to show me I was wrong. Donald Trump knows that in the work of revitalizing communities, America’s strength is Americas people and I can tell you, he really cares and he takes action.  Ja’Ron Smith: ( 10:52 ) Every issue important to black communities has been a priority for him. Prison reform, rebuilding broken families, bringing jobs back to America, jobs in Cleveland, jobs in Detroit, jobs in Milwaukee. President Trump knows that education is the great equalizer. That’s why he secured record and permanent funding for historically black colleges and universities and is fighting hard for school choice. In the wake of the murder of Ahmaud Arbery, George Floyd, and LeGend Taliferro, a moment of national racial consciousness. I have seen his true conscience. I just wish everyone could see the deep empathy he shows to families whose loved ones were killed in senseless violence.  Ja’Ron Smith: ( 12:04 ) President Trump has made it clear that if you want safe communities, you must have police departments with the highest standards. I will never forget Strandhill Road or the people of Cleveland. They’re tough, smart, and tell it like it is. That’s President Trump. For a New Yorker, he’s got a lot of Cleveland heart, and I’m proud to say that he’s my president. God bless America.  Speaker 4: ( 12:49 ) People assume that if I’m not a Democrat anymore that I must be a Republican or I must be conservative. I still consider myself a liberal but liberalism has changed and I don’t fit there anymore.  Speaker 5: ( 13:05 ) As a black kid growing up in Texas, you were taught that you had to support Democrats because Republicans were for white people, supporting the rich, and we definitely weren’t rich.  Speaker 6: ( 13:16 ) Basically our default setting is to be a Democrat.  Speaker 7: ( 13:19 ) I’m a Democrat, my parents are Democrats.  Speaker 7: ( 13:21 ) I was a huge Obama supporter.  Speaker 8: ( 13:23 ) In the 2016 primary I voted for Bernie Sanders.  Speaker 4: ( 13:27 ) I mean I was a socialist.  Speaker 7: ( 13:32 ) It wasn’t until we got married and began expecting our own family that I began to kind of question whether or not the things that we were really promoting and supporting were in line with the way we were living and that was when the shift kind of began for us.  Speaker 8: ( 13:49 ) I was renting a room in this woman’s apartment. She had three or four kids from three or four different fathers, she was my age. Most of them were incarcerated. I asked her what do you do, she goes I’m in the system. It feels like Democrats sort of get people hooked on this drug of free money where they basically say if you want your fix you have to keep voting for us.  Speaker 5: ( 14:15 ) Then this bold man comes down the escalator in New York City. I couldn’t come out and say it right away, but deep down inside, I knew it was going to be the first Republican that I ever voted for.  Speaker 7: ( 14:35 ) His entire campaign was for all Americans. That was a turning point for me.  Speaker 4: ( 14:41 ) One of the hardest things to do is to challenge your own beliefs. Going straight to the source is really how I was able to overcome some of those pitfalls and so I want people to hear my story and know that you can actually go from being a Democratic socialist to a Trump supporter, but you have to look deeper.  Speaker 8: ( 15:01 ) I think there’s a political realignment that’s taking place. I’ve always been very anti-war and now Trump is by a mile the anti-war candidate. I’ve always been very much for free speech, Trump is now by a mile the more pro-free speech candidate.  Speaker 7: ( 15:17 ) What’s at stake in November is pretty much everywhere you look, you either see prosperity and liberty and things that you want to preserve or if you’re a Democrat everywhere you look you see something you want to tear down and remake in the image of some other country that’s not as successful as we are.  Speaker 6: ( 15:30 ) I’m trying to conserve our values, our constitution, our God-given rights, the right to bear arms, freedom of speech. All the things that’s always made this country great.  Speaker 4: ( 15:38 ) You know it took me a good long time to get here but I hope that Trump wins and that we can continue with the progress that he’s made and the policies that he’s put into place. Let’s get our economy back on track and let’s be moving in the right direction.  Jeff Van Drew: ( 15:52 ) Good evening. My name is Jeff Van Drew. I speak to you as a member of the Republican Party, but it always wasn’t that way. How I became a Republican says a lot about today’s Democratic Party. I’m from South Jersey, where we work hard, look after our neighbors, and care about our communities. Years ago, I was a local dentist and was asked by the Democrats to run for a town council seat. I had my doubts and I explained that my views were middle of the road to conservative, but the local leaders said the Democratic Party was a big tent and that they accepted people like me. I was elected to council as a Democrat, but as I won seats for county office, state legislature, and then Congress, I noticed things were changing. The Democratic Party had become less accepting of American tradition, less believing in American exceptionalism, less supportive of traditional faith and family. This was not the party that I knew.  Jeff Van Drew: ( 17:10 ) In 2018 after being elected to Congress as a Democrat, I was already uncomfortable with a San Francisco liberal running the House which is why my first vote in Congress was cast against Nancy Pelosi for speaker, but imagine how I felt after seeing members of The Squad quickly take control of the Democratic Party just weeks after being elected. The party had moved from liberal to radical. This new Democratic party wasn’t just for higher taxes. Now they were for open borders, against our police, and against our God-given rights. When the radical Democrats went after President Trump with impeachment, they made another mistake. Democratic leaders told me that I had to vote for impeachment or my life would be made difficult and I wouldn’t be allowed to run again. Listen, I’m from South Jersey, and you better come at me with more than just loud words and empty threats. I voted no on impeachment and it was an easy call.  Jeff Van Drew: ( 18:21 ) Soon after, I met with President Trump, and he made me feel more comfortable and welcome in the Oval Office than Nancy Pelosi ever made me feel in her caucus and a few days later, I officially changed parties and I became a Republican. Let me tell you about Joe Biden. When the Democrats tried to order me around, I was ready, willing and able to say I’ve had enough with their radical socialist agenda. Do you really believe Joe Biden is ready, willing and most of all able to do the same? As Joe says, “Come on man.” Joe Biden is being told what to do by the radicals running my former party, the same radicals trying to install him as their puppet president. When I’m at my local diner, I tell people that America is the best nation in the world and that President Trump has helped make it that way. Republicans, Independents, and even Democrats, they all know that in President Trump’s America, we have a strong military, strong support for our police, strong support for our veterans, and strong support for our seniors. In President Trump’s America, we have a strong supply chain, good schools, we’re energy independent and we protect our environment.  Jeff Van Drew: ( 19:46 ) There are a lot of Democrats who support our president and are disgusted for what their old party, what my old party, has become. Here’s my advice. Be true to who you are now, not who the Democrats used to be. That’s why I’m a proud Republican and why I will be voting for Donald Trump. Thank you, and may God bless you, God bless our president, and God bless the United States of America.  Michelle: ( 20:25 ) For me, the most important issue is jobs. We need to be able to pay our bills. I trust Donald Trump on jobs way more than I do Joe Biden. There is no doubt that Donald Trump has built the strongest economy we’ve ever seen and I know that he will do it again. Joe Biden doesn’t have the energy and his ideas like raising taxes, it’s going to hurt us. Electing Joe Biden as the president is a huge risk and I don’t want the future of my son in the hands of Joe Biden. I want my son to be able to go out and get a good education. I want the economy to be strong. I want the country that he lives in to be safe and I want our borders to be secure and I don’t want that in Joe Biden’s hands. Donald Trump has built the strongest economy we’ve ever seen, he has made our country safe and as a mom, those are things that I’m very proud of and those are things that are very important to me when I’m looking for a president. I am sticking with Donald Trump.  Stacia Brightmon: ( 21:34 ) My name is Stacia Brightmon. I am a single mother of two boys and I work in Houston, Texas for S&B Engineers and constructors as a warehouse receiving clerk. After serving my country in the Marine Corps, I worked various jobs, but I thought I needed a degree in order to have a career. I put myself into significant debt to earn my bachelor’s degree in finance. Despite my degree in all of my efforts, at one point, my boys and I even found ourselves homeless. After being laid off yet again, I received an email from the Texas Workforce Commission about S&B’s Women in Construction Earn While You Learn apprenticeship program. I thought I’d give it a try. I was a bit skeptical at first, but I said to myself, “Hey, if they’re willing to take a chance on me, I should be willing to take a chance on myself.”  Stacia Brightmon: ( 22:23 ) At the start of the program, I was making $16.00 an hour while I trained to become a pipe fitter helper. Looking back, it wasn’t easy, but boy was it worth it. I felt empowered that I was learning new skills and able to support my family again, I worked hard, got promoted, and even got a few raises. Later, I learned where President Donald Trump and Ivanka Trump were doing behind the scenes to make sure that people like me and you had a chance to rise up and succeed. President Trump started the National Council for the American Worker and the American Workforce Policy Advisory Board.  Stacia Brightmon: ( 22:56 ) Together with Ivanka, he wrote policies that made it easier for states and companies to give opportunities to hardworking Americans like me. The president and Ivanka also partnered with the Ag Council to launch FindSomethingNew.org, helping to connect workers with training and apprentice programs where they live. If you find yourself in a situation like mine where you feel you have nowhere to turn, nothing to really fall back on, and you feel like no one believes in you, go online to FindSomethingNew.org and see that President Trump believes in you and more importantly please believe in yourself. Keep trying, keep pushing. Times will get hard, remember, just a few years ago, I was homeless and you know what now? I’m set to close on a brand new home at the end of the month, so my message to you is keep pushing. You can do it. Find the training program like the one I participated in and like me, you have an opportunity to build a career in life that you’re proud of.  Stacia Brightmon: ( 23:55 ) So with that being said, I’d like to talk to you about a different kind of training. This is the Trump campaign’s national week of volunteer training. If you’re like me, you know how important it is to put Americans back to work, so get trained and get involved with the campaign. Go online to www.trumpvictory.com and sign up and keep the president fighting for you for another four years. Thank you and God bless.  Dan Scavino: ( 24:41 ) My name is Dan Scavino. When I was 16 years old, I got a part-time job at a golf course just outside of New York City. One day, I was cleaning golf clubs when a man pulled into the parking lot. There wasn’t a single person who didn’t know who it was. Everyone’s jaws were on the ground. It was Donald Trump. All I could think was nobody will ever believe this at school tomorrow. I never would have imagined it at this moment, but I’ve now been at President Trump’s side for almost 30 years. All these years later, there’s a part of me that still feels a sense of wonder every day when I consider the journey we have taken together and taken with so many of you watching tonight. Because my personal story with Donald Trump in so many ways is yours too. He saw potential in me, the spark. The possibility that I could be more, do more, and achieve more than even I thought was possible. That’s how he views this country. We have also just scratched the surface of what we can do together.  Dan Scavino: ( 25:50 ) If there’s one thing I hope you will hear from me tonight, it is this. President Trump is a kind and decent man. I wish you could be at his side with me to see his endless kindness to everyone he meets. The media can be a fog machine, creating a partisan mist around everything that’s hard to see through, but in 2016, you navigated through it all. You found your way through the swamp and you arrived safely on the other side with Donald J. Trump as your new president. There are some things that were true then, reasons why you choose him as your country’s leader that remain true today. You know the president cannot be bought. The American people must know their president isn’t building his life, he’s building yours. He knows the president cannot be bullied. President Trump is the first leader who’s been too strong, too tough, and too savvy to be crushed by the status quo establishment and the political media class. You know the president cannot be beaten. He’s got a fighting spirit like so many of you do, and winning for America is what he does. While they call it chaos, President Trump calls it change. Just think about what we achieved together with President Trump. The strongest economy in history, the lowest unemployment rate for almost all demographic groups, black Americans, Hispanic Americans, women, and so many more. He did that once, and he will do it again. You know it and I know it. We all just need somebody to believe in our capacity to do great things. Donald Trump believed in me when I was a teenage golf caddy and he was already one of the wealthiest, most famous people on the entire planet. He saw my potential even when I couldn’t. He sees greatness in our country too and in each of you, he believes the world you dream about at night can be yours. He truly is a man of the people.  Dan Scavino: ( 28:18 ) Just think about what he has done with this convention. You’ve heard from real Americans with real stories. People who are just like us. People whose lives have been forever impacted by the president and his policies. You’ve heard from people like John Peterson, who has a factory in Ohio. Tanya Weinreis, who has a small business in Montana. Jason Joyce, a fisherman from Maine, and Cris Peterson, a dairy farmer from Wisconsin. You’ve seen a man who turned his life around, get a second chance with a presidential pardon. You’ve seen brand new Americans become our fellow citizens in a ceremony at the White House. You’ve felt the passion of pro-life and religious freedom advocates and listened to the heartfelt words of a man whose family fled communism and oppression. Who needs a non-stop parade of politicians when you got an army of the people behind you? On November 3, vote for the man who believes in America, and believes in you. Vote for my friend, your friend, our friend, Donald J. Trump. Thank you and God bless the United States of America.  Mitch McConnell: ( 29:50 ) Good evening. It’s an honor to come before you tonight from the Commonwealth of Kentucky. As the only leader in Washington not from either New York or California, I consider it my responsibility to look out for middle America. This election is incredibly consequential for middle America. President Trump knows he inherited the first generation of Americans who couldn’t promise their children a better life than their own. He’s made it his mission of this administration to change that. I know because I work beside him every day. Today’s Democrat party doesn’t want to improve life for middle America. They prefer that all of us in flyover country keep quiet and let them decide how we should live our lives.  Mitch McConnell: ( 30:36 ) They want to tell you when you can go to work, when your kids can go to school. They want to tax your job out of existence and then send you a government check for unemployment. They want to tell you what kind of car you can drive, what sources of information are credible and even how many hamburgers you can eat. They want to defund the police and take away your Second Amendment rights. They want free healthcare for illegal immigrants yet they offer no protection at all for unborn Americans. They want to pack the Supreme Court with liberals intent on eroding our constitutional rights and they want to codify all this by making the swamp itself, Washington D.C., America’s 51st state with two more liberal senators, we cannot undo the damage they’ve one.  Mitch McConnell: ( 31:27 ) Now you understand why Democrats spent an entire week telling us about who Joe Biden is, not what he intends to do. I’m immensely proud of the work the Republican Senate has done. We are the firewall against Nancy Pelosi’s agenda. Like President Trump, we won’t be bullied by a liberal media intent on destroying America’s institutions. We will stand our post on behalf of the millions of Americans whose stories aren’t told in today’s newspapers, whose struggles are just as real. We will continue to support American families as we defeat the coronavirus and return our economy to the envy of the world. The stakes have never been higher, which is why I’m asking you to support Republican senate candidates across the country and re-elect my friend President Donald Trump.  Donald Trump: ( 32:27 ) So all of these titans of American sport know that many of life’s most valuable lessons are learned on the field of competition and the ability to overcome adversity.  Donald Trump: ( 32:43 ) And your relentless will to win, win, win. These qualities embody the American spirit of pushing boundaries, defying limits.  Speaker 9: ( 32:57 ) It’s a game cast in sports immortality.  Donald Trump: ( 33:00 ) And always striving for greatness. You stayed in the fight, you finished the fight, often bumpy roads lead to beautiful places. This great building is celebrating great people, and you’re winners all.  Kevin McCarthy: ( 33:14 ) Would you please rise for the playing of our national anthem?  Donald Trump: ( 33:22 ) It’s our honor to be in the company of great, great champions.  Speaker 10: ( 33:26 ) Team USA will indeed take home the gold.  Donald Trump: ( 33:30 ) We have to get our sports back. We can’t wait to see what’s next. Never give up, never lose faith, never, ever quit. Just keep forging ahead. Give everything you’ve got. Victory is always within reach.  Dana White: ( 33:50 ) Hey everyone. I am Dana White, the president of the UFC. Many of you know who I am, what I do, and that I am friends with the president. I spoke at this convention four years ago and I’m back because I believe we need President Trump’s leadership now more than ever. Before the pandemic, President Trump built the greatest economy in our nation’s history and created opportunities for all Americans like no one before him. Financial markets hit all-time highs, unemployment was at an all-time low and we weren’t facing the lawless destruction that now is occurring in a few of our great cities. It blows my mind how quickly some of the leadership in this country has forgotten the critical role first responders play in our society. Police departments and other law enforcement, even some fire departments, have faced opposition from many in this country, but they are always the people who are asked to step up when things are at their worst and put themselves at risk. That has certainly been the case during this ongoing pandemic. Come on America, defunding these vital positions is not the answer. The first responders –  Dana White: ( 35:03 ) … positions is not the answer. The first responders have always taken care of us and now more than ever, we need to take care of them. Now, let’s talk about COVID and let’s be very honest about it. No one person and no one place could have anticipated the challenges that COVID would bring. But, President Trump has faced all these obstacles head-on. He immediately put protective measures in place and he reached out to the best and the brightest leading American businesses, across all industries, to discuss what he and his administration could do to get the economy back up and running safely.  Dana White: ( 35:39 ) Let me give you more detail. In early April, President Trump organized a task force of business leaders across the country. I was fortunate enough to serve on that task force. Firsthand, I had the opportunity to witness how hardworking and determined President Trump was, to solve unprecedented problems our country was facing. I personally observed his ability to listen and understand the issues impacting Americans of all backgrounds. It was clear, his highest priority was always the health and safety of everyone in our country. Not just Republicans, not just supporters, but every single American.  Dana White: ( 36:22 ) President Trump recognized that one of the small ways to instill a sense of normalcy in people’s lives, was to bring back entertainment options. The President went above and beyond to help all sports leagues involved, figure out a way to overcome the challenges of staging live professional sporting events in the middle of a pandemic. You know what? We did it. The UFC was the first to do it and we are continuing to do it.  Dana White: ( 36:48 ) Now, other sports have joined us and some of the lessons learned are being used to help reopen other types of businesses and schools. Make no mistake about it, we still have a long way to go. That is why we need a leader with President Trump’s unique attributes at this critical time. I have said it before, and I will say it again. He is one of the most loyal human beings I have ever met. The man has unstoppable energy. No one, and I mean no one, is going to outwork this guy.  Dana White: ( 37:22 ) But, most importantly, he truly loves and believes in our country. He believes in the people of this country. America is a place, everyone wants a solid job. They want to take care of their family. They want to support the community, assist the less fortunate and enjoy the freedom this country has provided to all of us. While we have certainly experienced a ton of negativity in 2020, President Trump’s mindset is to work tirelessly to find solutions to problems and help restore America. He did it once, and I’m telling you right now, he will do it again. Remember, President Trump may be the only president in modern times who has actually done everything he said he would do during his campaign. There’s this quote that I love from Ronald Reagan, where he said, “There isn’t any problem we can’t solve, if government will give us the facts, tell us what needs to be done, then get out of the way and let us have at it.” What that means to me, is as Americans, we work hard to overcome adversity and we face the tough times head-on. Irrespective of your gender, race, religion, or sexual orientation, what unites us as a nation, is freedom, equality, and opportunity. That’s what it means to be an American.  Dana White: ( 38:47 ) Ladies and gentlemen, let’s re-elect President Trump. Let’s figure out what the problems are and continue to find solutions to those problems. Then, let’s get to work. I’d like to close with this. While it’s critically important to re-elect President Trump, this pandemic has also taught us to be very, very careful who you select as your next governor, senator, congressperson and mayor. It is so important to vote. Don’t think that your vote doesn’t matter, because to be honest with you, it has never mattered more than it does right now. Thank you and have a great evening, America.  Sean Reyes: ( 39:28 ) [foreign language 00: 04:34], and good evening. I’m Utah Attorney General, Sean Reyes. I’m a proud American and proud descendant of warrior ancestors, women and men alike, from my Hawaiian, Filipino, Japanese, and Spanish heritage. My father demonstrated his warrior spirit over 50 years ago, fighting a dictator in his homeland, the Philippines. Barely escaping with his life, he started anew in America. He arrived with nothing, but faith, determination, and a willingness to work hard. He lived the American dream, building businesses, a family, and seeing me become Utah’s first minority statewide elected official.  Sean Reyes: ( 40:22 ) Today, I channel my warrior roots by battling human trafficking. I’ve been able to lead some of the largest trafficking prosecutions in America, and traveled to foreign countries, working with law enforcement and NGOs to dismantle trafficking networks and rescue people from the most brutal conditions imaginable. Young girls and women sold into sex slavery. Young boys and men forced into labor servitude. Illegal adoptions, organ harvesting, human life utterly debased.  Sean Reyes: ( 40:58 ) President Donald Trump is a fierce warrior against human trafficking. How do I know? Early in 2017, I had occasion to visit with him about our rescues. He asked insightful questions, expressed deep concern for victims. Overwhelmed with compassion, he promised to attack this evil. President Trump summoned Ivanka and leaders from his cabinet, directing resources and hundreds of millions of dollars for raising awareness, liberating victims, prosecuting predators, and empowering survivors. Together, they’ve done more to combat human trafficking than any administration in modern history. Now, that’s a promise kept.  Sean Reyes: ( 41:45 ) President Trump’s taken similar, aggressive action to break the chains of drug addiction and improve mental and behavioral health. He declared the opioid epidemic, a national public health emergency and made available billions of dollars to confront this threat. He also signed a bill, creating a phone number like 911, but for mental health. When activated, 988 will be a lifeline for those struggling with thoughts of suicide, depression, addiction, self-harm, or even hurting others. It will save countless American lives.  Sean Reyes: ( 42:27 ) A few months ago, my father, my warrior hero, lost his fight with cancer. When he passed, he had by his bedside, his scriptures, family photos, and a pen President Trump gave me to give him. Dad loved that pen. It represented freedom to him. The freedom that only exists when someone is willing to fight for it. To my father, President Trump is that ultimate warrior fighting for our freedom.  Sean Reyes: ( 43:02 ) If you listen to Democrats, the media and liberal elite, they will tell you that America’s light doesn’t shine as brightly around the world as it once did. That is simply not true. The same light that brought my father to America, inspires the desperate and downtrodden equally today. Believe me. I interact with some of the most marginalized victims on earth and they love America. They love President Trump, because he’s fighting for their freedom and America’s freedom. Thank you, President Trump. God bless you, and God bless America, this land of greatness.  Debbie Flood: ( 43:46 ) My name is Debbie Flood. I own a small foundry and machine shop in Wisconsin, that manufacturers cast bronze architectural hardware. My father, who was a World War II veteran, started the business with some used equipment and the American dream. Today, we are one of the only U.S. companies left, who make our products from start to finish under one roof. We really make things and we love it.  Debbie Flood: ( 44:27 ) When we lost nearly 50% of our business to China in the mid-2000s, we wondered how a small company like ours could continue to compete. At that time, Joe Biden was a Senator. He voted to normalize trade with China and help pave the way for them to join the WTO, even though they were hurting American companies like ours. But, we’re tenacious and we’re creative. We took a risk and purchased a 3D printer. 3D printing technology allows us to do things that China can’t.  Debbie Flood: ( 44:59 ) Now, we can take a customer’s idea from sketch to sample to production, in just a few weeks. This opened up new opportunities for us. Later, we fought our way through the great recession. Then, Donald Trump was elected and we breathed a sigh of relief. He actually fought for American workers and American craftsmen. He actually cared about bringing back those three beautiful words, Made In America.  Debbie Flood: ( 45:28 ) We no longer had to succeed despite government. Now, the government was on our side. We enjoyed a thriving economy stimulated by President Trump’s pro-business and pro-worker policies. Thanks to the Trump tax cuts, I’ve been able to raise my employees’ wages. So, they got a pay raise and a tax cut. Even in the face of the pandemic, the President doubled down on his support for business. Thanks to President Trump, our business was approved for the Paycheck Protection Program. That allowed us to keep our people working at a time when the future was very uncertain.  Debbie Flood: ( 46:06 ) Our President understands that the best solutions unleash the innovation of American entrepreneurs and the creativity of American workers. Joe Biden doesn’t really know anything about business or creating jobs. He spent 47 years in government and it’s doubtful that he’ll finally figure it out in year 48. He’s pledged to raise our taxes and bring back excessive regulation. I own a business whose mission it is to solve problems. Anything can be solved with a little creativity. It takes courage, commitment, and ideas. Those are all things that come naturally to President Trump, and that’s why he has my support.  Judy Smith: ( 47:03 ) My name is Judy Smith.  Manuel Martinez: ( 47:04 ) My name is Manuel Martinez.  Claudia Perez: ( 47:07 ) My name is Claudia Perez.  Judy Smith: ( 47:08 ) I live in New York City public housing.  Manuel Martinez: ( 47:12 ) I’m the Resident Council President for South Jamaica Houses.  Claudia Perez: ( 47:15 ) I am Resident Council President of Washington Houses, which is in Spanish Harlem.  Carmen Quinones: ( 47:22 ) My name is Carmen Quinones. I’m the President of Douglas Houses, 3,500 strong residents here. I am a lifelong Democrat. I would really hate to get started on this mayor.  Claudia Perez: ( 47:37 ) Bill de Blasio and the way he has dealt with public housing residents is disgraceful.  Carmen Quinones: ( 47:44 ) This mayor has made our lives here, and I think every housing development, very uncomfortable.  Manuel Martinez: ( 47:53 ) Under the Trump administration, New York City Housing Authority has received an influx of cash that it has not seen since 1997.  Judy Smith: ( 48:01 ) I’m grateful for the spotlight that President Trump is putting on New York City public housing. I think it’s wrong that the Democrats put illegal immigrants before Black Americans. How is it that we have people waiting on the waiting list for New York City public housing for 10 years or more, but yet we have legal immigrants living here? Something is wrong with that picture.  Manuel Martinez: ( 48:31 ) Since HUD came in with Lynne Patton as the regional director for HUD, it helped us identify some long systemic problems that we are now putting on the table and having discussions on.  Claudia Perez: ( 48:46 ) President Trump’s administration have opened their ear and have listened. There’s been improvement in public housing. We’re very appreciative of this administration that has come and finally shine the light on what’s going on and bringing real solutions to a real problem.  Ann Dorin: ( 49:19 ) Hello, my name is Ann Dorn. I’d like to introduce you to my husband, David, father of five, brother of 12, grandfather of 10, friend to thousands. He was the most kind, dedicated, loving life partner I could have hoped for. He had a big smile and a heart to match. He was blessed with the gift of gab and that gift enabled him to touch souls and inspire people, especially young people. Oh, how kids loved him and they really loved him back. Dave was all about service. He served 38 years in the St. Louis Metropolitan Police Department, and six years as Chief of Police as the Moline Acres Police Department.  Ann Dorin: ( 50:07 ) After 44 years, he retired from law enforcement. But, he never retired from helping a friend in need. Since he befriended every person he met, he was a very busy man. One example of that, was his friendship with a young man named Lee. Dave had met him when Lee was just a kid, after members of his family were attacked and murdered. Dave took a special interest in the boy. They bonded and their friendship grew and remained strong throughout the years.  Ann Dorin: ( 50:40 ) Lee eventually opened a pawn shop. He trusted Dave implicitly and asked Dave to help with security. Dave had readily agreed. Whenever the shop’s alarm would go off, the alarm company called Dave. He would investigate. If he got a call or if I went to bed, he would wake me up and tell me he was going to Lee’s, just to make sure everything was all right. Most of the time, they were false alarms triggered by a storm or animals. But, I never rested easily until I heard Dave’s key turn the door, knowing he was home safe.  Ann Dorin: ( 51:19 ) The alarm that went off the morning of June 2nd was for real. It was a violent night in St. Louis. Four officers were shot. Others were hit with rocks and fireworks. At least five businesses were damaged, looted or set on fire. As the Officer Wellness Coordinator and CIT coordinator with the police department, I was keenly aware of the rioting and spent the evening getting ready to mobilize support for officers who were impacted.  Ann Dorin: ( 51:50 ) After I’d gone to bed, David received a call from Lee’s alarm company. The front door of the pawn shop had been breached. This time, he didn’t wake me up to tell me. He probably knew I would have tried to stop him or insist on going with him. As I slept, looters were ransacking the shop. They shot and killed Dave in cold blood, and then livestreamed his execution and his last moments on earth. David’s grandson was watching the video on Facebook in real time, not realizing he was watching his own grandfather dying on the sidewalk.  Ann Dorin: ( 52:41 ) I learned of all this around 4:00 AM. When our doorbell rang, the Chief of Police was standing outside. I wondered why Dave had not answered the door. It wasn’t uncommon for him to be up watching TV at this time. I called out to him several times. There was no reply. He just wasn’t there. I led in the chief and fighting back tears, he added the words every officer’s spouse dreads.  Ann Dorin: ( 53:14 ) I relive that horror in my mind every single day. My hope is that having you relive it with me now, will help shake this country from this nightmare we’re witnessing in our cities and bring about positive, peaceful change. How did we get to this point, where so many young people are callous and indifferent towards human life? This isn’t a video game, where you can commit mayhem and then just hit reset and bring all the characters back to life.  Ann Dorin: ( 53:51 ) David is never, never coming back to me. He was murdered by people who didn’t know and just didn’t care. He would have done anything to help them. Violence and destruction are not legitimate forms of protest. They do not safeguard black lives. They only destroy them. President Trump understands this, has offered federal help to restore order in our communities. In a time when police departments are short on resources and manpower, we need that help. We should accept that help. We must heal before we can affect change. But, we cannot heal amid devastation and chaos. President Trump knows we need more Davids in our communities, not fewer. We need to come together in peace and remember that every life is precious.  Ja’Ron Smith: ( 54:57 ) Good evening. I’m Ben Carson, a retired neurosurgeon and a public servant. Before I begin, I’d like to say that our hearts go out to the Blake family and the other families who’ve been impacted by the tragic events in Kenosha. As Jacob’s mother has urged the country, let’s use our hearts, our love, and our intelligence to work together, to show the rest of the world how humans are supposed to treat each other. America is great when we behave greatly.  Ja’Ron Smith: ( 55:37 ) In order to succeed and change, we must first come together in love of our fellow citizens. History reminds us that necessary change comes through hope and love, not senseless and destructive violence. Abraham Lincoln once said to an America divided that, “Your purpose, then, plainly stated, is that you will destroy the government, unless you be allowed to construe and enforce the Constitution as you please, on all points in dispute between you and us. You will rule or ruin in all events.”  Ja’Ron Smith: ( 56:22 ) These words of warning are relevant today. We have a choice. Do we want big government that controls our lives from cradle to grave? Or, do we believe in the power and wisdom of the people and their ability to self-govern, with help from a limited federal government? Our president, Donald J. Trump, believes in the people. He is one of us. He makes promises and he keeps them. He is transparent, and we certainly know what he’s thinking. He does not submit to political correctness or towards enforces the media. He is real.  Ja’Ron Smith: ( 57:07 ) Right now, we need real. We need courage. We can’t cower in a corner and hope that no one calls us a name, believing that will keep us safe. That is not courage, and that will not lead us to a good and just place. We must remember all those who sacrificed everything in order to give us freedom, and we must be willing to do the same for those who come after us.  Ja’Ron Smith: ( 57:38 ) President Trump does not dabble in identity politics. He wants everyone to succeed and believes in the adage, a rising tide lifts all boats. Many on the other side, love to incite division, by claiming that President Trump is a racist. They could not be more wrong. Years ago, Jesse Jackson gave Donald Trump an award for the economic opportunities he created for black people. In Palm beach, Florida, Donald Trump led the crusade to allow blacks and Jews into private clubs and resorts.  Ja’Ron Smith: ( 58:17 ) One of the first things he did as president, was bring the office of historically black colleges and universities into the White House, so that it could get proper attention and financial support. Before the pandemic, African-American unemployment was at an all time low. President Trump accomplished prison reform. He created incentives to encourage investors to become involved with economically deprived areas of America.  Ja’Ron Smith: ( 58:47 ) He strongly supports school choice, fully recognizing that no matter what circumstances a person is born into, they can achieve success with a good education. It was true for me. When my mother forced me to read books about doctors, entrepreneurs, inventors, and scientists, I began to recognize that the person who has the most to do with what happens to you in life, is you. My mother always told me, “Ben, you can do anything. But, I will never allow you to become a victim.” It was then that I stopped listening to the people who were trying to convince me that I was a victim, and that others were responsible for my victimhood.  Ja’Ron Smith: ( 59:36 ) What is racist, is the fact that African-Americans have the highest abortion rate. President Trump is the most pro-life president in the country’s history. He will continue to fight for those who cannot yet speak. The vision of a shining city upon a hill came from Jesus’s Sermon on the Mount. America is that shiny city. We are the beacon of hope for the world. At this moment in time, President Donald Trump is the man with the courage, the vision, and the ability to keep it shining brightly.  Pat Lynch: ( 01:00:28 ) I’m Pat Lynch, President of the Police Benevolent Association, speaking to you on behalf of 50,000 active and retired New York City police officers. We are the proud men and women who wear a shield on our chest and put ourselves in harm’s way to protect our city. We are proud to endorse our president, Donald J. Trump, for re-election because the stakes have never been higher. Like cops across the country, we are staring down the barrel of a public safety disaster. More than 1000 people have been shot in New York City so far this year. Almost 300 have been killed. These are not just numbers. These are real people.  Pat Lynch: ( 01:01:04 ) A father gunned down while holding his seven-year-old daughter’s hands. A beloved neighborhood peacemaker killed by a stray bullet. A 17-year-old who made all the right choices, who worked hard to go to college and earned a sports scholarship, murdered before he can tell his mother the news. A one-year-old child shot dead in his stroller. Innocent people, innocent lives lost. One tragedy is too many, but every day the number keeps growing. Every day our communities are asking us, “Why is this happening?”  Pat Lynch: ( 01:01:34 ) The answer is simple. The Democrats have walked away from us. They have walked away from police officers and they’ve walked away from the innocent people we protect. Democratic politicians have surrendered our streets and our institutions. The loudest voices have taken control and our so-called leaders are scrambling to catch up with them. In city after city, they’ve slashed police budgets. They have hijacked and dismantled the criminal justice system. They’ve passed laws that made it impossible for police officers to do our job effectively.  Pat Lynch: ( 01:02:08 ) Here’s the sad truth that every cop in this country knows. The violence and chaos we’re seeing now, isn’t a side effect. It isn’t an unintended consequence. It’s actually the goal. The radical left doesn’t really want better policing. They don’t really care about making the justice system fairer. What they want is no policing. What they want is a justice system that just stops working altogether.  Pat Lynch: ( 01:02:33 ) In places where Democrats are in power, the radical left is getting exactly what they want and our country is suffering for it. I’ve been a New York City police officer for 36 years. I’ve spent 21 of those years, protecting the cops who protect New Yorkers. I’ve never seen our streets go this bad so quickly. I’ve never heard from so many cops from every corner of the country who are saying the same thing, “Our hands are tied.”  Pat Lynch: ( 01:02:58 ) If we’re going to turn the tide and restore law and order, we cannot fall into the left’s trap. There is nobody who hates bad cops, more than good cops. But, that doesn’t matter to the radical left. To them, we’re all just bad because we’re all just blue. Their anti-law enforcement campaign isn’t about a single incident. It isn’t the result of one bad law or one bad policy. It’s about a message. The message is, police officers are the enemy. The message is, criminals have the right to resist arrest. The message is, if you commit a crime, if you victimize the most vulnerable of people, the justice system will not hold you accountable.  Pat Lynch: ( 01:03:37 ) That’s the message echoing through city halls and state houses across our country. It’s playing on a loop in the media. The criminals have heard that message and they’re taking full advantage. We must stop that message. We must expose the left’s lies about police officers and the job that we do. We will do that because we have something that they don’t. We have a real leader. We have a powerful voice in the most powerful office in our country. We have President Donald J. Trump.  Pat Lynch: ( 01:04:06 ) Unlike the Democrats who are running in fear of the mob in the street, President Trump has never apologized for supporting police officers and standing up for law and order. Unlike the Democrats who froze in the face of rioting and looting, President Trump matches his words with his actions. He gives law enforcement the support and the tools we need, to go out there and put a stop to it, period, in the story.  Pat Lynch: ( 01:04:29 ) It’s never been harder to be a police officer in this country, but there are two things that keep us going. We look at the victims, the vulnerable, the regular working people who count on us. We keep strapping on our duty belts and bullet resistant vests because we know we can’t let them down. While we do that, we hear the words of our president who says to police officers everywhere, “I will never let you down.”  Pat Lynch: ( 01:04:55 ) We know that he hasn’t, and we know that he won’t. We’ve been fortunate to have him in office these past four years and we know that we cannot afford to lose him. When it comes to your safety, your family’s safety, and the safety of all Americans, there’s no other choice. You won’t be safe in Joe Biden’s America. We can have four more years of President Trump or you can have no safety, no justice, and no peace.  Rudy Giuliani: ( 01:05:26 ) Good evening. My name is Rudy Giuliani and I’m the former mayor of New York City. In 2013, my city elected a self-described progressive Democrat as mayor. New York City once described as America’s crime capital, had become by the mid-1990s, America’s safest large city. Now today, my city is in shock. Murders, shootings, and violent crime are increasing at percentages unheard of in the past. We’re seeing the return of rioting and looting. During riots, this Democrat mayor, like others, has often prevented the police from making arrests. Even when arrests are made, liberal, progressive DAs release the rioters, so as not to disrupt the rioting.  Rudy Giuliani: ( 01:06:25 ) New Yorkers wonder, “How did we get overwhelmed by crime so quickly, and to climb so fast?” Don’t let Democrats do to America, what they have done to New York. Again, the Democrats are urging you to vote for an obviously defective candidate. Biden has changed his principle so often, he no longer has any principles. He’s a Trojan horse with Bernie, AOC, Pelosi, Black Lives Matter, and his party’s entire left wing, just waiting to execute their pro-criminal, anti-police, socialist policies.  Rudy Giuliani: ( 01:07:07 ) The whole unprecedented wave of lawlessness began with a truly just cause, the unforgivable police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis. Peaceful protests began all over the land. The condemnation of the killing was universal, from President Trump to Democrat leaders. It seemed for a few brief shining moments, Democrat and Republican leaders would come together with a unified proposal to reduce police misconduct. This possibility was very dangerous to the left. They had a president to beat and a country to destroy.  Rudy Giuliani: ( 01:07:50 ) Although an agreement on action against police brutality would be very valuable for the country, it would also make President Trump appear to be an effective leader. They could have none of that. So, Black Lives Matter and Antifa sprang into action. In a flash, they hijacked the peaceful protests into vicious, brutal riots. Soon, protests turned into riots in many other American cities, almost all Democrat. Businesses were burned and crushed. People beaten, shot, and killed. Police officers routinely assaulted, badly beaten, and occasionally murdered. And, the police handcuffed by progressive Democrat mayors from doing anything, but observe the crimes and absorb the blows.  Rudy Giuliani: ( 01:08:38 ) But, the worst of it, was the slaughter of innocent young people with their whole lives ahead of them. The murder of four-year-old LeGend Taliferro in Kansas City shocked the nation, but not Black Lives Matter or there are many Democrats supporters. 17-year-old basketball star, Brandon Hendrix, was killed in The Bronx just days after graduating high school and on his way to St. John’s to play basketball. He passed with only a brief mention. One-year-old Davell Gardner Jr. was shot and killed in a stroller at a cookout in Brooklyn and it caused no outrage.  Rudy Giuliani: ( 01:09:23 ) For President Trump and for us Republicans, all black lives matter. The lives of LeGend and Brandon and Davell matter to us. All lives matter to us. These continuous riots in Democratic cities gives you a good view of the future under Biden. All five of the top cities for homicides, like the top cities for rioting and looting, are governed by progressive Democrats. Using the progressive Democrat approach to crime, which is to do nothing substantive to reduce it, to release-  Rudy Giuliani: ( 01:10:03 ) Is to do nothing substantive to reduce it. To release prisoners as many, and as soon as possible, and to go to war with the police, the only group with the capability to protect your citizens. It is clear that a vote for Biden and the Democrats creates the risk that you will bring this lawlessness to your city, to your town, to your suburb. There is no question that this awesome job of restoring safety for our people cannot be done from your basement Joe. There’s also no question that President Trump will fight with all his strengths to preserve the American system of government and our way of life.  Rudy Giuliani: ( 01:10:50 ) In critical times in our history, America has always been blessed with the right person to handle the crisis. Washington, Lincoln, Roosevelt, Reagan were perfect for the challenges they faced and brought our nation through gloriously. President Trump, with his boundless love of our country and all our people, his disciplined work ethic, his exceptional ability to inspire and his deep understanding of our system of government and the strength of American values is the man we can trust to preserve and even improve our way of life. Mr. President make our nation safe again.  Speaker 1: ( 01:11:33 ) A U.S. Attorney announced charges against Dr. Charles Lieber and two Chinese nationals today.  Tucker Carlson: ( 01:11:49 ) A systematic decision by many of our country’s most powerful leaders to sell out America to China.  Joe Biden: ( 01:12:00 ) China is going to eat our lunch, come on man.  Speaker 12: ( 01:12:03 ) A 2013 trip to China, getting new attention this morning, not for what Joe Biden did, but for who he brought with him.  Tucker Carlson: ( 01:12:13 ) As a threat from China grew larger and more threatening, Biden seemed to grow more accommodated to the Chinese government.  Speaker 11: ( 01:12:19 ) Questions about money he made from foreign business dealings while his father was vice president.  Speaker 13: ( 01:12:24 ) And they knew they could get to Joe Biden’s heart through his son, Hunter Biden.  Speaker 14: ( 01:12:28 ) They hoped to raise $1.5 billion. One person who did not want to talk about it, Joe Biden.  Tucker Carlson: ( 01:12:36 ) When it was already clear China had lied to the world in ways that hurt the world about a deadly outbreak of the Wuhan coronavirus. Biden was still flacking for the Chinese government.  Joe Biden: ( 01:12:53 ) They’re not bad folks, folks. But guess what? They’re not competition for us.  Nancy Pelosi: ( 01:13:01 ) China would prefer Joe Biden.  Senator Tom Cotton: ( 01:13:13 ) Good evening. I’m Senator Tom Cotton. A lot’s changed in four years back then we gathered in a rowdy arena. Tonight you’re probably at home while I stand alone. Stands alone, that was the motto of my old army unit, the 506 infantry, the original band of brothers. From the Normandy beaches to the Iraqi desert, we fought alongside each other, but we were always prepared to stand alone. And so it is with our nation, we lead the free world, but we’ll stand alone if we must, to defend America. Donald Trump understands this, he puts America first. That’s why America is safer now than four years ago. But Joe Biden would return us to a weak and dangerous past. Barack Obama’s own Secretary of Defense said Joe Biden has been wrong on nearly every major national security decision over the past four decades.  Senator Tom Cotton: ( 01:14:16 ) So let’s compare the records of Joe Biden and Donald Trump. Joe Biden slashed defense spending again and again. President Trump rebuilt our military, and added the space force. Joe Biden let ISIS terrorists rampage across the Middle East. President Trump eliminated ISIS’s leader and destroyed its caliphate. Joe Biden opposed the mission to kill Osama bin Laden. President Trump avenge the murder of hundreds of Americans by killing Iran’s terrorist mastermind, Qasim Solaimani. Joe Biden sent pallets of cash to the Ayatollahs. President Trump ripped up the dangerous Iran nuclear deal. Joe Biden treated Israel like a nuisance. President Trump moved our embassy to Jerusalem, and brokered peace deals in the Middle East. Joe Biden cuddled socialists dictators in Cuba and Venezuela. President Trump fights against communism in America’s backyard and around the world.  Senator Tom Cotton: ( 01:15:24 ) And on the communist party of China, there is no comparison. Joe Biden aided and abetted China’s rise for 50 years with terrible trade deals that closed our factories and laid off our workers. President Trump stands up the China’s cheating and stealing and lying. Joe Biden allowed Chinese fentanyl to flood across our Southern border. President Trump sanctioned Chinese drug dealer for poisoning our kids. Joe said Chinese communist aren’t even our competitor, aren’t bad folks, just months before they unleashed this plague on the world. President Trump is clear eyed about the Chinese threat and he is making China pay. But China’s not giving up, in fact, they’re rooting for Joe Biden. America’s other enemies won’t give up either, but Joe Biden would be as wrong and weak over the next four years as he has been for the last 50.  Senator Tom Cotton: ( 01:16:28 ) We need a president who stands up for America, not one who takes a knee. A strong and proud America is a safe America, safe from our enemies and safe from war. No one who’s seen the face of war desires to see it again. Too many of our fellow Americans or already honored at the hallowed grounds of Arlington. But if we want peace, we must be strong. Weakness is provocative. President Trump’s strength has kept us out of war. Joe Biden won’t stand up for America. Donald Trump will. So this November let’s stand with the President and vote to keep America great.  Marcia Mueller: ( 01:17:34 ) My name is Marsha Mueller. This is my husband, Carl. Our daughter, Kayla, was taken as a hostage and murdered by ISIS. From a young age Kayla was amazing. She taught herself languages, how to write music, how to play guitar, she worked with troubled youth, military veterans, and native Americans. Everywhere Kayla went, people smiled. Kayla had a gift to be able to see the world through someone else’s eyes. She became a humanitarian aid worker. And when she was helping children at an orphanage in India, Kayla wrote, “I find God in the suffering eyes reflected in mine. If this is how you are revealed to me, this is how I will forever seek you.” She went to Turkey to help Syrian refugees in 2012. In August, 2013, she was asked by another aid worker to cross the border into Syria to help at a hospital. On August 4th, 2013, ISIS terrorist stopped her vehicle and took her captive.  Carl: ( 01:18:48 ) Kayla was mostly held in a 12 by 12 cell in solitary confinement. It was cold and dirty, ISIS terrorist shine bright lights in her face. They shaved her head, they beat her and tortured her. The leader of ISIS, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi raped her repeatedly. For 18 months she endured. And we endure an agonizing back and forth between us, the Obama administration and ISIS. We put all our faith in the government, but the government let us down. President Obama refused to meet with us until ISIS had already beheaded other Americans. To this day we never heard from Joe Biden. Instead the Obama administration hid behind policy so much that we felt hopeless when they kept us from negotiating to save Kayla’s life. The administration showed more concern for the terrorists in Guantanamo than the American hostages in Syria.  Carl: ( 01:19:50 ) The military prepared a rescue mission, but the White House delayed it. By the time it went forward Kayla had been moved to another location. After 18 months of brutal torture, we learned from ISIS that Kayla had been killed. The Obama administration kept telling us they were doing everything they could, but their version of everything wasn’t enough. What a difference a President makes. Under president Trump, U.S. army special operators conducted a raid on al-Baghdadi’s compound. After we learned that al-Baghdadi was killed, we learned something else, the operators named themselves Taskforce 814, after August 14th, Kayla’s birthday. And the mission was named Operation Kayla Mueller. To those soldiers, thank you. Kayla was looking down on you.  Carl: ( 01:20:48 ) The Trump team gave us empathy. We never received from the Obama administration. The Obama administration said it was doing everything it could. The Trump administration is. Let me just say this, Kayla should be here. If Donald Trump had been President, when Kayla was captured, she would be here today. When Kayla was a hostage, I’d go outside at night and look at the moon. I’d look at moon and I’d promise her I’d do everything I could to get her home. Now when I see the moon, I’m reminded of my promise to her I couldn’t keep.  Marcia Mueller: ( 01:21:31 ) All Kayla wanted was to make it home. We are still working to find her and God willing we will bring her home. Kayla was born a miracle. We were told we would never have a second child, but God gave us Kayla. And she gave herself to the world. Eight months into Kayla’s captivity. Another hostage was to smuggle out a letter Kayla had written. As we read it, we could see that God was holding her in his arms. In her words, she felt tenderly, cradled in freefall. She also wrote, “I have been shown in darkness light, and have learned that even in prison one can be free. I am grateful. I have had many hours to think how only in your absence have I finally at, 25 years old, come to realize your place in my life. None of us could have known it would be this long, but know I am also fighting from my side in the ways I am able, and I have a lot of fight left inside of me. I am not breaking down and I will not give in no matter how long it takes.”  Marcia Mueller: ( 01:22:43 ) Kayla taught me so many things as her mom. She’s still teaching us. Carl and I support Donald Trump because of his commitment to make and keep America great not with the power of the government, but with the passion of people like Kayla. Americans who even in the darkest days, always have more fight left inside of them. Americans who don’t just talk, they act. That was our daughter. That’s President Trump. As long as we stay strong like Kayla, as long as we refuse to break, we will be great. Thank you.  Alice Marie Johnson: ( 01:23:22 ) I’m free to hug my family. I’m free to start over. This is the greatest day of my life. My heart is just bursting with gratitude. I want to thank President Donald Trump.  President Donald Trump: ( 01:23:55 ) Almost all people said that Criminal Justice Reform would never pass. But we came together as a group, we worked across party lines and we got it done.  Alice Marie Johnson: ( 01:24:05 ) I’m an example of a woman who has been given a second chance in life. God bless you and God bless America. Good evening. I’m Alice Marie Johnson. I was once told that the only way I would ever be reunited with my family would be as a corpse. But by the grace of God and the compassion of President Donald John Trump, I stand before you tonight, and I assure you I’m not a ghost. I am alive. I am well. And most importantly, I am free. In 1996, I began serving time in prison. Life plus 25 years. I had never been in trouble. I was a first time non-violent offender. What I did was wrong. I made decisions that I regret.  Alice Marie Johnson: ( 01:25:10 ) Some say you do the crime, you do the time. However, that time should be fair and just. We’ve all made mistakes. None of us want to be defined forever based on our worst decision. While in prison, I became a playwright, a mentor, a certified hospice volunteer, an ordained minister, and received the special Olympics Event Coordinator of The Year Award for my work with disabled women, because the only thing worse than unjustly imprisoning my body is trying to imprison my mind. My transformation was described as extraordinary. Truth is there are thousands of people just like me who deserve the opportunity to come home. I never stopped fighting for my freedom. My Christian faith and the prayers of so many kept hope alive.  Alice Marie Johnson: ( 01:26:16 ) When President Trump heard about me, about the injustice of my story, he saw me as a person. He had compassion, and he acted. Free in bodied thanks to President Trump, but free in man, thanks to the Almighty God. I couldn’t believe it. I always remembered that God knew my name even in my darkest hour, but I never thought a President would. When I was released on June six, 2018, I ran across that road and hugged my grandchildren for the first time. I’ll never forget that feeling. And then I remembered the promise I had made to the men and women I left behind, that I would never stop fighting for them and I haven’t. I’m using my voice to tell their stories. And I pray that my face reminds you of those forgotten faces.  Alice Marie Johnson: ( 01:27:24 ) Six months after President Trump granted me a second chance, he signed The First Step Act into law. It was real justice reform, and it brought joy hope and freedom to thousands of well deserving people. I hollered, “Hallelujah.” My faith in justice and mercy was rewarded. Imagine getting to hug your loved ones again, and to think this first step meant so much to so many. I can’t wait because we’re just getting started. The nearly 22 years I spent in prison were not wasted. God had a purpose and a plan for my life. I was not delayed or denied. I was destined for such a time as this. I pray that you will not just hear this message, but that you will be inspired by my story, and your compassion will lead you to take action for those who are forgotten. This what our President Donald Trump did for me, and for that, I will be forever grateful. God bless you, God bless President Trump and God bless America. Thank you.  Speaker 15: ( 01:29:05 ) It’s one of the great American success stories. A builder who left his mark on skylines around the world. A businessman with an extraordinary ability to communicate directly with the American people. A leader who grew tired of politicians leading our country down a road to ruin. He didn’t do it for money or power or fame. He had all that. He did it because of his love for our great country.  President Donald Trump: ( 01:29:32 ) And we will make America great again.  Speaker 15: ( 01:29:35 ) Donald J. Trump beat the odds, smashed the establishment, and won the presidency for the American people.  Speaker 16: ( 01:29:43 ) Donald Trump has defeated Hillary Clinton to become President elect.  Speaker 17: ( 01:29:46 ) Hillary Clinton has called Donald Trump to concede the race.  Speaker 18: ( 01:29:51 ) It has been a stunning night, it has been a historic night.  Sean Hannity: ( 01:29:54 ) Washington D.C., the establishment is terrified. And they shouldn’t be, they will all, all of them wrong, making this one of the greatest upsets in American political history.  Speaker 15: ( 01:30:07 ) Immediately upon taking office, President Trump changed things, but change threatened the establishment, and the establishment fought back. Democrat obstruction, phony investigations, the dishonest media, an incredible 92% of stories are negative. No president has seen anything like it. Despite everything they threw at him, President Trump delivered for the American people, and he delivered like never before. Building the strongest economy in American history, 7 million new jobs, the lowest ever unemployment for Black and Hispanic Americans ending the Biden era of lopsided trade deals that sent our factories overseas, passing the historic USMCA, taking on China, winning the trade war, protecting and strengthening Medicare and social security, lowering the cost of insulin, delivering the first real drop in drug prices in 50 years, restoring our military, fixing the VA, bringing our troops home and taking the world’s deadliest terrorists off the battlefield Soleimani, al-Baghdadi, ISIS brought to justice.  Speaker 15: ( 01:31:19 ) Moving America’s embassy to Jerusalem, a new era of strength and solidarity with our ally Israel, negotiating a historic peace deal between Israel and the United Arab Emirates, securing our border miles of new border wall being built illegal immigration dropped to the lowest point in a decade, tackling the Coronavirus head-on, fanning travel from China, mobilizing government, business and the American people to manufacture masks, ventilators and medical supplies, and launching Operation Warp Speed, an unprecedented effort to develop a vaccine to eradicate the Coronavirus from the face of the earth in record time. President Trump has accomplished more for the American people in four years than any other president in history. And in his second term, he will lead America to even greater heights, draining the swamp, rebuilding the economy, bringing back millions of jobs, creating 10 million new jobs in 10 months, new opportunities for all Americans, not just those at the top, lowering drug costs, expanding access to high quality healthcare for every American family, defending America’s police, restoring law and order to our cities, stopping illegal immigration, and protecting American families, and ending America’s reliance on China once and for all, bringing back jobs and factories, making medicine and products in America again.  Speaker 15: ( 01:32:51 ) President Trump will rebuild America’s infrastructure, renew hope, and our entrepreneurial spirit for a new generation, and restore the American dream. It won’t be easy, never pretty. The swamp will continue to fight him every step of the way. But under President Trump, our families will thrive, our incomes will rise, our communities will be kept safe, our factories will flourish, our flag will fly high, our country will soar, and we will make America great again.  Speaker 19: ( 01:33:33 ) Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome Ivanka Trump.  Ivanka Trump: ( 01:34:04 ) Good evening. Before I begin, I want to send a special message to everyone who’s been affected by Hurricane Laura. Our hearts are with you. The President will continue to support you every step of the way. And just like Americans always do, the nation will come together to help you rebuild your homes, businesses and communities stronger and more resilient than ever before. Four years ago, I introduced to you a builder, an entrepreneur, an outsider, and the people’s nominee for President of the United States. Tonight, I stand before you, as the proud daughter of the people’s President He is our Commander in Chief, champion of the American worker, defender of common sense and our voice for the forgotten men and women of this country, he is our President and my father, Donald J. Trump.  Ivanka Trump: ( 01:35:24 ) This evening, I want to tell you about the leader I know and the moments I wish every American could see. I want to tell you the story of a President who is fighting for you from Dawn to midnight, when the cameras have left, the microphones are off, and the decisions really count. When Jared and I moved with our three young children to Washington, we didn’t exactly know what we were in for, but our kids, our kids loved it from the start. My son, Joseph promptly built grandpa a Lego replica of the White House. The president still displays it on the mantle in the oval office, right over there, so that he can show world leaders just so they know he has the greatest grandchildren on earth. I agree.  Ivanka Trump: ( 01:36:15 ) Over the last four years, we’ve learned a lot. I’ve seen in Washington, it’s easy for politicians to survive if they silent convictions and skip the hard fights. I couldn’t believe so many politicians actually prefer to complain about a problem rather than fix it. I was shocked to see people leave major challenges, unsolved, so they can blame the other side, campaign on the same issue in the next. But Donald Trump did not come to Washington to win praise from the Beltway Elites, Donald Trump came to Washington for one reason, and one reason alone, to make America great again. My father has strong convictions. He knows what he believes, and he says what he thinks. Whether you agree with him or not, you always know where he stands. I recognize that my dad’s communication style is not to everyone’s taste, and I know that his tweets can feel a bit unfiltered, but the results speak for themselves. He’s so unapologetic about his beliefs that he has caused me and countless Americans to take a hard look at our own convictions and ask ourselves, “What do we stand for? What kind of America do we want to leave for our children?”  Ivanka Trump: ( 01:37:52 ) I am more certain than ever before we want a future where our kids can believe in American greatness, we want a society where every child can live in a safe community and go to a great school of their choice, we want a culture where differences of opinion and debate are encouraged, not canceled, where law enforcement is respected, where our country’s rich diversity is celebrated, and where people of all backgrounds, races, genders, and creeds have the chance to achieve their God given potential. This is the future my father is working to build each and every day.  Ivanka Trump: ( 01:38:38 ) Building, after all, is what he’s done his whole life. He’s admired and befriended construction workers on countless job sites, but it has been a new and profound experience for him and for me to see these stoic machinists, this steelworkers, come to him with a tear in their eye and thank him for being the only person willing to go to the mat for them, for their jobs, for their families and for their futures. To the hardworking men and women across America, and here tonight, you are the reason my father fights with all of his heart and all of his might, you are the reason he ran for president in the first place, and you are the reason he is going to keep fighting for four more years.  Ivanka Trump: ( 01:39:47 ) I remember one evening in early February of 2018, we were in the oval office with my father’s top economic advisors, and the president was pushing to keep the promise he made to renegotiate the bad trade deals that had gutted millions of middle class jobs. Most of his advisors argued that the economy was so strong following our historic tax and regulatory cuts, that it didn’t make sense to risk rocking the boat. After the meeting, as I walked with my father back towards the residence, he said, “You know, the reason this has never been done before is because our leaders haven’t had the guts. When the economy is good, they settle for good. And when things are bad, they don’t have the will or ability. So they kick the kid until it’s someone else’s problem.” He was right. If my father didn’t take on these fights, no one would.  Ivanka Trump: ( 01:40:38 ) In the months that followed President Trump refused to settle for a good deal, he wanted a great deal, and ultimately that is exactly what we got. I remember each time he was updated on the progress of the new trade deal with Mexico and Canada, he would say, “Don’t let down those dairy farmers I met in Wisconsin. I don’t want them to like the deal. I want them to love it.” Today in the midst of this unprecedented global pandemic, it’s more clear than ever that our president was absolutely correct to take on trade when he did, and bring our jobs, our factories, and our lifesaving medicines, back to the USA.  Ivanka Trump: ( 01:41:29 ) As our nation endures this grave trial, I pray for the families who were mourning the loss of a loved one, for those who are battling COVID-19, and for the first responders and the healthcare heroes who remain on the frontline of this fight. The grief, sorrow, and anxiety during this time is felt by all. I’ve been with my father, and I’ve seen the pain in his eyes when he receives updates on the lives that have been stolen by this plague, I’ve witnessed him make some of the most difficult decisions of his life. I sat with him in the oval office, as he stopped travel to Europe. I watched him take the strongest, most inclusive economy in a lifetime, the lowest unemployment in a half century, and the highest wage increase for working families in decades, and closed it down to save American lives. It is why our President rapidly mobilize the full force of government and the private sector to produce ventilators within weeks, to build the most robust testing system in the world, and to develop safe and effective treatments, and very, very soon a vaccine. My father isn’t deterred by the defeaters thinkers. The word impossible, well it only motivates him. Donald Trump rejects the cynical notion that this country’s greatest achievements are behind us. He believes that nothing is beyond our reach, and that the best is yet to come.  Ivanka Trump: ( 01:43:16 ) I have seen all of my life, how my dad believes in the potential of each individual. Earlier this evening, we were all inspired by the incredible testimony of Alice Johnson, a great grandmother who was sentenced to life in prison for a first time nonviolent drug offense. I was with my father when he decided to commute Alice’s life sentence. Together we watched Alice leave prison after nearly 22 years, as she ran into the arms of her family and they celebrated a joyful reunion, my father got very quiet, I could see the emotion on his face. After a long silence, he looked at me and said, “Imagine how many people there are just like Alice.” From that point on, he became a voice for those who had been unfairly silenced in our prison system.  Ivanka Trump: ( 01:44:07 ) President Trump rectified the disparities of the 1994 Biden Crime Bill that disproportionately hurt African Americans. Against all odds, he brought together Republicans and Democrats, and passed the most significant criminal justice reform of our generation. And we’re just getting started. My father did not campaign on this issue. He tackled this injustice because he has a deep compassion for those who have been treated unfairly. More than rhetoric and political pros, the ability to build consensus and achieve bipartisan success will help heal our country’s racial inequities, and bring us forward together. President Trump is advancing.  Ivanka Trump: ( 01:45:03 ) President Trump is advancing the American values of work and family. Four years ago in Cleveland, I said president Trump would deliver for working women. Last year, over 70% of all new jobs were secured by women. Four years ago, I told you my father would focus on making childcare affordable and accessible. In president Trump’s first term, we secured the largest ever increase for childcare funding, giving more than 800,000 low income families great childcare at a cost they can afford. As part of Republican tax cuts, in 2019 alone, our child tax credit put over $2,000 into the pockets of 40 million American families. Democrat politicians recently introduced a plan to increase the child tax credit. Yet when I was fighting less than three years ago at the president’s direction to get Congress to double the child tax credit, not a single Democrat voted to pass the law. We got it done anyway. Four years ago, I promised that president Trump would support mothers in the workforce. In his first year in office, he signed into law the first ever national paid leave tax credit. Today, eight million more Americans have access to this benefit.  Ivanka Trump: ( 01:46:42 ) Four years ago, I said that Americans needed an economy that permits people to rise again. During president Trump’s first three years in office, 72% of all new jobs went to Americans who had been outside of the workforce. Four years ago, I told you I would fight alongside my father, and four years later here I am. Many of the issues my father has championed are not historically Republican priorities, yet where Washington chooses sides, our president chooses common sense. Where politicians choose party, our president chooses people. Since the day he took the oath of office, I’ve watched my father take on the failed policies of the past and do what no leader has done before. Recently, he took dramatic action to cut the cost of prescription drugs, despite fielding angry calls from the CEOs of nearly every major pharmaceutical company. Now, when we see attack ads paid for by Big Pharma, my dad smiles and says to me, ” You know we’re doing something really right if they’re hitting us so hard.”  Ivanka Trump: ( 01:48:06 ) This spring, our president saw that American crops were going to waste because food supply chains were disrupted by the virus. He directed Secretary Perdue and me to find a way to get this nutritious food, fresh fruit, vegetables, meat and dairy to families most in need. Within a matter of days, we launched the Farmers to Family Food Box Program, which has now delivered over a hundred million meals into the hands of American families. To protect the most vulnerable among us, I’ve worked alongside the president as he signed into law nine pieces of legislation to combat the evil of human trafficking. I’ve stood by my father’s side at Dover Air Force Base as he’s received our fallen heroes, and each time it has steeled his resolve to finally stop, finally stop the endless foreign wars.  Ivanka Trump: ( 01:49:19 ) To change the paradigm in the Middle East, he took a fresh approach. I heard foreign leaders beg him not to move the American embassy to Jerusalem, yet he delivered on a promise, also made anD unfulfilled by past presidents because my father knew that it was the right thing to do. Defying all expectations, just weeks ago, he rewrote history again by making a peace agreement in the Middle East, the biggest breakthrough in a quarter century. For the first time in a long time, we have a president who has called out Washington’s hypocrisy and they hate him for it. Dad, people attack you for being unconventional, but I love you for being real, and I respect you for being effective.  Ivanka Trump: ( 01:50:37 ) Our president refuses to surrender his beliefs to score point with the big political elite. To my father, you are the elite. You are the only people he cares about scoring points with. If these problems were easy to solve, previous presidents would have done so, but you don’t achieve different results by doing things the same way. Washington has not changed Donald Trump. Donald Trump has changed Washington. America doesn’t need another empty vessel who will do whatever the media and the fringe of his party demands. Now more than ever, America needs four more years of a warrior in the White House. Tonight, I could not be more proud to introduce my father, a man I know was made for this moment in history. My fellow Americans, our First Lady and the 45th president of the United States, Donald J. Trump. (Singing)  Donald Trump: ( 01:54:41 ) Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you very much. Friends, delegates, and distinguished guests, please, I stand before you tonight, honored by your support, proud of the extraordinary progress we have made together over the last four incredible years, and brimming with confidence in the bright future we will build for America over the next four years. We begin this evening. Our thoughts are with the wonderful people who have just come through the wrath of Hurricane Laura. We are working closely with state and local officials in Texas, Louisiana, Arkansas, Mississippi, sparing no effort to save lives. While the hurricane was fierce, one of the strongest to make landfall in 150 years, the casualties and damage were far less than thought possible only 24 hours ago. And this is due to the great work of FEMA, law enforcement, and the individual states. I will be going this weekend and congratulations, thank you for that great job out there, we really appreciate it.  Donald Trump: ( 01:56:16 ) We are one national family and we will always protect, love, and care for each other. Here tonight are the people who have made my journey possible and filled my life with so much joy. For her incredible service to our nation and its children, I want to thank our magnificent First Lady. I also want to thank my amazing daughter Ivanka for that introduction and to all of my children, Ivanka, please stand up. Thank you. And to all of my children and grandchildren, I love you more than words can express. I know my brother Robert is looking down on us right now from heaven. He was a great brother and was very proud of the job we are all doing. Thank you. We love you, Robert.  Donald Trump: ( 01:57:48 ) Let us also take a moment to show our profound appreciation for a man who has always fought by our side, and stood up for our values. A man of deep faith and steadfast conviction, our vice president, Mike Pence. And Mike is joined by his beloved wife, a teacher and military mom, Karen Pence. Thank you Karen.  Donald Trump: ( 01:58:40 ) My fellow Americans, tonight with a heart full of gratitude and boundless optimism, I profoundly accept this nomination for president of the United States. The Republican party, the party of Abraham Lincoln, goes forward united, determined, and ready to welcome millions of Democrats, Independents, and anyone who believes in the greatness of America and the righteous heart of the American people. In a new term as president, we will again build the greatest economy in history, quickly returning to full employment, soaring incomes, and record prosperity. We will defend America against all threats and protect America against all dangers. We will lead America into new frontiers of ambition and discovery, and we will reach for new heights of national achievement. We will rekindle new faith in our values, new pride in our history, and a new spirit of unity that can only be realized through love for our great country. Because we understand that America is not a land cloaked in darkness. America is the torch that enlightens the entire world.  Donald Trump: ( 02:00:55 ) Gathered here at our beautiful and majestic White House, known all over the world as the people’s house, we cannot help but marvel at the miracle that is our great American story. This has been the home of larger than life figures like Teddy Roosevelt, and Andrew Jackson, who rallied Americans to bold visions of a bigger and brighter future. Within these walls lived tenacious generals like president Grant, and Eisenhower, who led our soldiers in the course of freedom. From these grounds, Thomas Jefferson sent Lewis and Clark on a daring expedition to cross a wild and uncharted continent. In the depths of a bloody civil war, president Abraham Lincoln looked out these very windows upon a half-completed Washington Monument and asked God in his Providence to save our nation. Two weeks after Pearl Harbor, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, welcomed Winston Churchill, and just inside, they set our people on a course to victory in the Second World War.  Donald Trump: ( 02:02:26 ) In recent months, our nation and the entire planet has been struck by a new and powerful invisible enemy. Like those brave Americans before us, we are meeting this challenge. We are delivering life-saving therapies and we’ll produce a vaccine before the end of the year, or maybe even sooner.  Donald Trump: ( 02:02:59 ) We will defeat the virus, end the pandemic, and emerge stronger than ever before. What united generations past was an unshakeable confidence in America’s destiny and an unbreakable faith in the American people. They knew that our country is blessed by God and has a special purpose in this world. It is that conviction that inspired the formation of our union, our westward expansion, the abolition of slavery, the passage of civil rights, the Space Program and the overthrow of fascism, tyranny, and communism. This towering American spirit has prevailed over every challenge and lifted us to the summit of human endeavor. And yet, despite all of our greatness as a nation, everything we have achieved is now in danger. This is the most important election in the history of our country. Thank you. At no time before have voters faced a clearer choice between two parties, two visions, two philosophies, or two agendas. This election will decide whether we save the American dream or whether we allow a socialist agenda to demolish our cherished destiny. It will decide whether we rapidly create millions of high paying jobs or whether we crush our industries and send millions of these jobs overseas as has foolishly been done for many decades. Your vote will decide whether we protect law abiding Americans, or whether we give free reign to violent anarchists, and agitators, and criminals who threaten our citizens. And this election will decide whether we will defend the American way of life or whether we will allow a radical movement to dismantle and destroy it. It won’t happen. At the Democrat National Convention, Joe Biden and his party repeatedly assailed America as a land of racial, economic, and social injustice. So tonight I ask you a simple question; how can the Democrat party ask to lead our country when it spends so much time tearing down our country?  Donald Trump: ( 02:06:18 ) In the left’s backward view, they do not see America as the most free, just, and exceptional nation on earth. Instead they see a wicked nation that must be punished for its sins. Our opponents say that redemption for you can only come from giving power to them. This is a tired anthem spoken by every repressive movement throughout history. But in this country, we don’t look to career politicians for salvation. In America, we don’t turn to government to restore our souls. We put our faith in almighty God. Joe Biden is not a savior of America’s soul, he is the destroyer of America’s jobs, and if given the chance, he will be the destroyer of American greatness. For 47 years, Joe Biden took the donations of blue collar workers, gave them hugs and even kisses, and told them he felt their pain. And then he flew back to Washington and voted to ship our jobs to China and many other distant lands. Joe Biden has spent his entire career outsourcing their dreams and the dreams of American workers, offshoring their jobs, opening their borders, and sending their sons and daughters to fight in endless foreign wars, wars that never ended. Four years ago I ran for president because could not watch this betrayal of our country any longer. I could not sit by as career politicians let other countries take advantage of us on trade, borders, foreign policy, and national defense. Our NATO partners, as an example, were very far behind in their defense payments, but at my strong urging, they agreed to pay $130 billion more a year, the first time in over 20 years that they upped their payments. And this $130 billion will ultimately go to $400 billion a year. And Secretary General Stoltenberg who heads NATO was amazed after watching for so many years, and said that president Trump did what no one else was able to do. Thank you. From the moment I left my former life behind, and it was a good life, I have done nothing but fight for you. I did what our political establishment never expected and could never forgive, breaking the Cardinal rule of Washington politics. I kept my promise. Together we have ended the rule of the failed political class and they are desperate to get their power back by any means necessary, you’ve seen that. They are angry at me because instead of putting them first, I very simply said, ” America first.”  Donald Trump: ( 02:11:08 ) Thank you. Days after taking office, we shocked the Washington establishment and withdrew from the last administration’s job-killing Trans-Pacific Partnership. I then immediately approved the Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines, and did the unfair and very costly Paris Climate Accord, and secured for the first time, American energy independence. We passed record setting tax and regulation cuts at a rate nobody had ever seen before. Within three short years, we built the strongest economy in the history of the world. Washington insiders asked me not to stand up to China. They pleaded with me to let China continue stealing our jobs, ripping us off, and robbing our country blind. But I kept my word to the American people. We took the toughest, boldest, strongest, and hardest hitting action against China in American history by far.  Donald Trump: ( 02:12:46 ) They said that it would be impossible to terminate and replace NAFTA, but again, they were wrong. Earlier this year, I ended the NAFTA nightmare and signed the brand new US-Mexico- Canada Agreement into law. And right now auto companies and others are building their plants and factories in America, not firing their employees, and not deserting us for other countries.  Donald Trump: ( 02:13:23 ) In perhaps no area did the Washington special interests try harder to stop us than on my policy of pro-American immigration. But I refused to back down and today America’s borders are more secure than ever before. Thank you. We ended catch and release, stopped asylum fraud, took down human traffickers who prey on women and children, and we have deported 20,000 gang members and 500,000 criminal aliens.  Donald Trump: ( 02:14:24 ) We have already built 300 miles of border wall, and we are adding 10 new miles every single week. The wall will soon be complete, and it is working beyond our wildest expectations. We are joined this evening by members of the Border Patrol Union representing our country’s courageous border agents. Thank you very much for being here. Thank you. Brave, brave people. You see this country loves our law enforcement, they do, they do, they really do. Love and respect. When I learned that the Tennessee Valley Authority laid off hundreds of American workers and forced them to train their lower paid foreign replacements, I promptly removed the chairman of the board and now those talented American workers have been rehired and are back providing power to Georgia, Alabama, Tennessee, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, and Virginia.  Donald Trump: ( 02:16:08 ) They have their old jobs back, and some are here with us this evening. Please stand. You went through a lot, please stand. Thank you. Thank you very much. You’ve been through a lot. Last month, I took on Big Pharma. You think that’s easy? It’s not. And signed orders that will massively lower the cost of your prescription drugs and give critically ill patients access to lifesaving cures. We passed the decade’s long awaited right to try, right to try. We also passed VA Accountability and VA Choice. Our great veterans. We’re taking care of veterans. 91% approval rating this month, the VA given by our veterans, first time anything like that’s ever happened. By the end of my first term, we will have approved more than 300 federal judges, including two great new Supreme Court Justices. And to bring prosperity to our forgotten inner cities, we worked hard to pass historic criminal justice reform, prison reform, opportunity zones, and longterm funding of Historically Black Colleges and Universities. And before the China virus came in, produced the best unemployment numbers for African Americans, Hispanic Americans, and Asian Americans ever recorded.  Donald Trump: ( 02:18:07 ) And I say very modestly that I have done more for the African American community than any president since Abraham Lincoln, our first Republican president. And I have done more in three years for the Black community than Joe Biden has done in 47 years.  Donald Trump: ( 02:18:57 ) And when I’m reelected, the best is yet to come. Thank you very much. When I took office, the Middle East was in total chaos. ISIS was rampaging, Iran was on the rise, and the war in Afghanistan had no end in sight. I withdrew from the terrible one-  Donald Trump: ( 02:20:03 ) I withdrew from the terrible, one-sided Iran nuclear deal. Unlike many presidents before me, I kept my promise, recognized Israel’s true capital and moved our embassy to Jerusalem. But not only did we talk about it as a future site, we got it built. Rather than spending $1 billion on a new building as planned, we took an already owned existing building and a better location, real estate deal, right? Opened it at a cost of less than $500,000. Many things like that that government is doing right now. We also recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights, and this month we achieved the first Middle East peace deal in 25 years. Thank you to UAE, thank you to Israel. In addition, we obliterated 100% of the ISIS caliphate and killed its founder and leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. Then, in a separate operation, we eliminated the world’s number one terrorist by far, Qasem Soleimani. Unlike previous administrations, I have kept America out of new wars and our troops are coming home. We have spent nearly $2. 5 trillion on completely rebuilding our military, which was very badly depleted when I took office, as you know. This includes three separate pay raises for our great warriors. We also launched the Space Force, the first new branch of the United States military since the Air Force was created almost 75 years ago.  Donald Trump: ( 02:23:13 ) We have spent the last four years reversing the damage Joe Biden inflicted over the last 47 years. Biden’s record is a shameful roll call of the most catastrophic betrayals and blunders in our lifetime. He has spent his entire career on the wrong side of history. Biden voted for the NAFTA disaster, the single worst trade deal ever enacted. He supported China’s entry into the world trade organization, one of the greatest economic disasters of all time. After those Biden calamities, the United States lost one in four manufacturing jobs. We laid off workers in Michigan, Ohio, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, and many other States.  Donald Trump: ( 02:24:06 ) They didn’t want to hear Biden’s hollow words of empathy. They wanted their jobs back. As Vice President, he supported the transpacific partnership, which would have been a death sentence for the US auto industry. He backed the horrendous South Korea trade deal, which took many jobs from our country, and which I’ve reversed and made a great deal for our country. He repeatedly supported mass amnesty for illegal immigrants. He voted for the Iraq war. He opposed the mission to take out Osama bin Laden. He opposed killing Soleimani. He oversaw the rise of ISIS and cheered the rise of China as a positive development for America and the world. Some positive development. That’s why China supports Joe Biden and desperately wants him to win. I can tell you that upon very good information. China would own our country if Joe Biden got elected. Unlike Biden, I will hold them fully accountable for the tragedy that they caused all over the world, they caused. In recent months, our nation and the world has been hit by the once in a century pandemic that China allowed to spread around the globe. They could have stopped it, but they allowed it to come out. We are grateful to be joined tonight by several of our incredible nurses and first responders. Please stand and accept our profound thanks and gratitude. Many Americans, including me, have sadly lost friends and cherished loved ones to this horrible disease. As one nation, we mourn, we grieve, and we hold in our hearts forever the memories of all of those lives that have been so tragically taken, so unnecessary. In their honor, we will unite, in their memory we will overcome. When the China virus hit, we launched the largest national mobilization since World War II. Invoking the Defense Production Act, we produced the world’s largest supply of ventilators, not a single American who has needed a ventilator has been denied a ventilator, which is a miracle. Good job heading the task force by our great Vice President. Thank you very much, Mike, please, please stand up.  Donald Trump: ( 02:27:25 ) We shipped hundreds of millions of masks, gloves, and gowns to our frontline healthcare workers. To protect our nation’s seniors, we rushed supplies, testing kits, and personnel to nursing homes. We gave everything you can possibly give, and we’re still giving it because we’re taking care of our senior citizens. The Army Corps of Engineers built field hospitals, and the Navy deployed our great hospital ships. We developed from scratch the largest and most advanced testing system anywhere in the world. America has tested more than every country in Europe put together, and more than every nation in the Western hemisphere combined. Think of that.  Donald Trump: ( 02:28:12 ) We have conducted 40 million more tests than the next closest nation, which is India. We developed a wide array of effective treatments, including a powerful antibody treatment known as convalescent plasma. You saw that on Sunday night when we announced it, that will save thousands and thousands of lives. Thanks to advances we have pioneered the fatality rate and you look at it and you look at the numbers, it has been reduced by 80% since April, 80%. The United States has among the lowest case fatality rates of any major country anywhere in the world. The European Union’s case fatality rate is nearly three times higher than ours, but you don’t hear that. They don’t write about that. They don’t want to write about that. They don’t want you to know those things.  Donald Trump: ( 02:29:09 ) All together, the nations of Europe have experienced a 30% greater increase in excess mortality than the United States, think of that. We enacted the largest package of financial relief in American history. Thanks to our paycheck protection program, we have saved or supported more than 50 million American jobs. That’s one of the reasons that we’re advancing so rapidly with our economy. Great job. As a result, we have seen the smallest economic contraction of any major Western nation, and we are recovering at a much faster rate than anybody. Over the past three months, we have gained over nine million jobs, and that’s a record in the history of our country. Unfortunately, from the beginning, our opponents have shown themselves capable of nothing but a partisan ability to criticize. When I took bold action to issue a travel ban on China, very early indeed, Joe Biden called it hysterical and xenophobic. Then, I introduced a ban on Europe very early again. If we had listened to Joe, hundreds of thousands more Americans would have died. Instead of following the science, Joe Biden wants to inflict a painful shutdown on the entire country. His shutdown would inflict unthinkable and lasting harm on our nations children’s, families, and citizens of all backgrounds.  Donald Trump: ( 02:30:51 ) The cost of the Biden shutdown would be measured in increased drug overdoses, depression, alcohol addiction, suicides, heart attacks, economic devastation, job loss, and much more. Joe Biden’s plan is not a solution to the virus, but rather it’s a surrender to the virus. My administration has a very different approach. To save as many lives as possible, we are focusing on the science, the facts, and the data. We are aggressively sheltering those at highest risk, especially the elderly, while allowing lower risk Americans to safely return to work and to school. We want to see so many of those great States be opened by Democrats. We want them to be opened. They have to be opened. They have to get back to work.  Donald Trump: ( 02:31:56 ) They have to get back to work and they have to get back to school. Most importantly, we are marshaling America’s scientific genius to produce a vaccine in record time. Under Operation Warp Speed, we have three different vaccines in the final stage of trials right now, years ahead of what has been achieved before, nobody thought it could ever be done this fast. Normally it would be years, and we did it in a matter of a few months. We’re producing them in advance so that hundreds of millions of doses will be quickly available. We will have a safe and effective vaccine this year, and together we will crush the virus. At the Democrat convention, you barely heard a word about their agenda.  Donald Trump: ( 02:32:47 ) But that’s not because they don’t have one, it’s because their agenda is the most extreme set of proposals ever put forward by a major party nominee. Joe Biden may claim he is an ally of the light, but when it comes to his agenda, Biden wants to keep us completely in the dark. He doesn’t have a clue. He has pledged a $4 trillion tax site on almost all American families, which will totally collapse our rapidly improving economy. Once again, record stock markets that we have right now will also collapse. That means your 401ks, that means all of the stocks that you have. On the other hand, just as I did in my first term, I will cut taxes even further for hard working moms and dads.  Donald Trump: ( 02:33:42 ) I will not raise taxes, I will cut them and very substantially. We will also provide tax credits to bring jobs out of China back to America. We will impose tariffs on any company that leaves America to produce jobs overseas. We will make sure our companies and jobs stay in our country as I’ve already been doing for quite some time, if you’ve noticed. Joe Biden’s agenda is made in China, my agenda is made in the USA. Biden has promised to abolish the production of American oil, coal, shale, and natural gas laying waste to the economies of Pennsylvania, Ohio, Texas, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Colorado, and New Mexico. Destroying those States, absolutely destroying those States and others.  Donald Trump: ( 02:35:01 ) Millions of jobs will be lost, and energy prices will soar. These same policies led to crippling power outages in California just last week. Everybody saw that. Tremendous power outage. Nobody’s seen anything like it, but we saw that last week in California. How can Joe Biden claim to be an ally of the light when his own party can’t even keep the lights on? Joe Biden’s campaign has even published a 110-page policy platform. You can’t get away from this. Co-authored with far left Senator, crazy Bernie Sanders. The Biden-Bernie manifesto calls for suspending for removals of illegal aliens, implementing nationwide catch and release, and providing illegal aliens with free taxpayer funded lawyers. Everybody gets a lawyer come on over to our country. Everybody has a lawyer. We have a lawyer for you. That’s what we need is more lawyers. Joe Biden recently raised his hand on the debate stage and promised to giveaway, he was going to give it away your healthcare dollars to illegal immigrants, which is going to bring massive number of immigrants into our country. Massive numbers will pour into our country in order to get all of the goodies that they want to give, education, healthcare, everything. He also supports deadly sanctuary cities that protect criminal aliens. He promised to end national security travel bans from jihadist nations, and he pledged to increase refugee admissions by 700%.  Donald Trump: ( 02:36:57 ) This is in the manifesto. The Biden plan would eliminate America’s borders in the middle of a global pandemic, and he’s even talking about taking the wall down. How about that? Biden also vowed to oppose school choice and close all charter schools, ripping away the ladder of opportunity for black and Hispanic children. In this second term, I will expand charter schools and provide school choice to every family in America. We will always treat our teachers with the tremendous respect that they deserve. Great people. Great, great people. Joe Biden claims he has empathy for the vulnerable, yet the party he leads supports the extreme late term abortion of defenseless babies right up until the moment of birth.  Donald Trump: ( 02:38:09 ) Democrat leaders talk about moral decency, but they have no problem with stopping a baby’s beating heart in the ninth month of pregnancy. Democrat politicians refuse to protect innocent life, and then they lecture us about morality and saving America’s soul. Tonight, we proudly declare that all children born and unborn have a God-given right to life. During the Democrat Convention, the words under God were removed from the Pledge of Allegiance. Not once, but twice. We will never do that. But the fact is, this is where they’re coming from. Like it or not, this is where they’re coming from. If the left gains power, they will demolish the suburbs, confiscate your guns, and appoint justices who will wipe away your Second Amendment and other constitutional freedoms. Biden is a Trojan horse for socialism. If Joe Biden doesn’t have the strength to stand up to wild eyed Marxists like Bernie Sanders and his fellow radicals, and there are many, there were many, many, we see them all the times. It’s incredible, actually. Then, how is he ever going to stand up for you? He’s not. The most dangerous aspect of the Biden platform is the attack on public safety. The Biden-Bernie manifesto calls for abolishing cash bail, immediately releasing 400,000 criminals onto the streets and into your neighborhoods. When asked if he supports cutting police funding, Joe Biden replied, “Yes, absolutely.” When Congresswoman Ilhan Omar called the Minneapolis Police Department a cancer that is rotten to the root, Biden wouldn’t disavow her support and reject her endorsement.  Donald Trump: ( 02:40:35 ) He proudly displayed it. Shortly, later on his website, he displayed it in big letters. Make no mistake. If you give power to Joe Biden, the radical left will defund police departments all across America. They will pass Federal legislation to reduce law enforcement nationwide. They will make every city look like Democrat-run Portland, Oregon. No one will be safe in Biden’s America. My administration will always stand with the men and women of law enforcement. Every day, police officers risk their lives to keep us safe, and every year, many sacrifice their lives in the line of duty. One of these incredible Americans was Detective Miosotis Familia.  Donald Trump: ( 02:41:40 ) She was part of a team of American heroes called the NYPD, or New York’s Finest, who I was very, very proud to get their endorsement just the other day. Great people. Great, great people. If they were allowed to do their job, you’d have no crime in New York. Rudy Giuliani knows that better than anybody. Thank you, Rudy. Three years ago, in the 4th of July weekend, Detective Familia was on duty in her vehicle when she was ambushed just after midnight and murdered by a monster who hated her purely for wearing the badge. Detective Familia was a single mom. She recently asked for the night shifts so she could spend more time with her kids. Two years ago, I stood in front of the US Capitol alongside those beautiful children and held their grandmother’s hand as they mourned their terrible loss. We honored Detective Familia’s extraordinary life. It was extraordinary. Detective Familia’s three children are with us this evening. Genesis, Peter, Delilah, we are so grateful to have you here tonight. Thank you very much for coming. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. I promise you that we will treasure your mom in our memories forever. We must remember that the overwhelming majority of police officers in this country, and that’s the overwhelming majority, are noble, courageous, and honorable.  Donald Trump: ( 02:43:38 ) We have to give law enforcement, our police, back their power. They are afraid to act. They’re afraid to lose their pension. They’re afraid to lose their jobs, and by being afraid, they are not able to do the job that they so desperately want to do for you. Those who suffer most are the great people who they protect, and who they want to protect at an even higher level. When there is police misconduct, the justice system must hold wrongdoers fully and completely accountable, and it will. But when we can never have a situation where things are going on as they are today, we must never allow mob rule.  Donald Trump: ( 02:44:37 ) We can never allow mob rule. In the strongest possible terms, the Republican Party condemns the rioting, looting, arson, and violence we have seen in Democrat-run cities like Kenosha, Minneapolis, Portland, Chicago, and New York, and many others, Democrat- run. There is violence and danger in the streets of many Democrat-run cities throughout America. This problem could easily be fixed if they wanted to just call, we’re ready to go in. We’ll take care of your problem in a matter of hours, just call. We have to wait for the call. It’s too bad we have to, but we have to wait for the call. We must always have law and order. All federal crimes are being investigated, prosecuted, and punished to the fullest extent of the law.  Donald Trump: ( 02:45:35 ) When the anarchists started ripping down our statues and monuments right outside, I signed an order immediately, 10 years in prison, and it was a miracle. It all stopped. No more statues. They said, “That’s just too long.” As they looked at the statue, “I think we’ll rip it down.” Then, they said, “10 years in prison, I think that’s too long. Let’s go home.” During their convention, Joe Biden and his supporters remain completely silent about the rioters and criminals spreading mayhem in Democrat-run cities. They never even mentioned it during their entire convention. Never once mentioned. Now, they’re starting to mention it because their poll numbers are going down like a rock in the water.  Donald Trump: ( 02:46:26 ) It’s too late, Joe. In the face of left wing anarchy and mayhem in Minneapolis, Chicago, and other cities, Joe Biden’s campaign did not condemn it. They donated to it. At least 13 members of Joe Biden’s campaign staff donated to a fund to bail out vandals, arsenals, anarchists, looters, and rioters from jail. Here tonight is the grieving family of retired Police Captain David Dorn, a 38-year veteran of the St. Louis Police Department, a great man and a highly respected man by all. In June, Captain Dorn was shot and killed as he tried to protect a store from rioters and looters, or as the Democrats would call them, peaceful protestors.  Donald Trump: ( 02:47:17 ) They call them peaceful protestors. We’re honored to be joined tonight by his wonderful wife Ann, and beloved family members Brian and [inaudible 02:47:27]. To each of you, we will never forget the heroic legacy of Captain David Dorn. Thank you very much for being here. Thank you. Thank you very much. Great man. Great man. As long as I am President, we will defend the absolute right of every American citizen to live in security, dignity, and peace. If the Democrat Party wants to stand with anarchists, agitators, rioters, looters, and flag burners, that is up to them. But I, as your President, will not be a part of it. The Republican Party will remain the voice of the patriotic heroes who keep America safe and salute the American flag.  Donald Trump: ( 02:48:39 ) Last year, over 1,000 African Americans were murdered as a result of violent crime in just four Democrat-run cities. The top 10 most dangerous cities in the country are run by Democrats, and have been for many decades. Thousands, more African Americans are victim, and victims of violent crime in these communities. Joe Biden and the left ignore these American victims, I never will. If the radical left takes power, they will apply their disastrous policies to every city, town, and suburb in America. Just imagine if the so-called peaceful demonstrators in the streets were in charge of every lever of power in the US Government. Just think of that. Liberal politicians claimed to be concerned about the strength of American institutions, but who exactly is attacking them?  Donald Trump: ( 02:49:43 ) Who is hiring the radical professors, judges, and prosecutors? Who is trying to abolish immigration enforcement and establish speech codes designed to muzzle descent? In every case, the attacks on American institutions are being waged by radical left. Always remember, they’re coming after me because I am fighting for you. That’s what’s happening. It’s been going on from before I even got elected. Remember this, they spied on my campaign and they got caught. Let’s see now what happens. We must reclaim our independence from the left’s repressive mandates. Americans are exhausted trying to keep up with the latest list of approved words and phrases, and the ever more restrictive political decrees. Many things have a different name now, and the rules are constantly changing. The goal of cancel culture is to make decent Americans live in fear of being fired, expelled, shamed, humiliated, and driven from society as we know it. The far left wants to coerce you into saying what you know to be false and scare you out of saying what you know to be true, very sad. But on November 3rd, you can send them a very thundering message they will never forget. Thank you. Thank you very much. Joe Biden is weak. He takes his marching orders from Liberal hypocrites who drive their cities into the ground while fleeing far from the scene of the wreckage.  Donald Trump: ( 02:52:24 ) These same Liberals want to eliminate school choice while they enroll their children in the finest private schools in the land. They want to open our borders while living in Waldorf compounds and communities in the best neighborhoods in the world. They want to defund the police while they have armed guards for themselves. This November, we must turn the page forever on this failed political class. The fact is, I’m here. What’s the name of that building? But I’ll say it differently, the fact is, we are here and they’re not. To me, one of the most beautiful buildings anywhere in the world that is not a building, it’s a home as far as I’m concerned.  Donald Trump: ( 02:53:27 ) It’s not even a house, it’s a home. It’s a wonderful place with an incredible history, but it’s all because of you. Together, we will write the next chapter of the great American story. Over the next four years, we will make America into the manufacturing super power of the world. We will expand opportunity zones. Thank you, Tim Scott. Bring home our medical supply chains, and we will end our resilience for bad things. We will go right after China. We will not rely on them one bit. We’re taking our business out of China. We are bringing it home. We want our business to come home. We will continue to reduce taxes and regulations at levels not seen before.  Donald Trump: ( 02:54:25 ) We will create 10 million jobs in the next 10 months, and it will be higher than that. We will hire more police, increase penalties for assaults on law enforcement, and surge federal prosecutors into high crime communities. We will ban deadly sanctuary cities and ensure that federal healthcare is protected for American citizens, not for illegal aliens. We will have strong borders. I’ve said for years, without borders, we don’t have a country. We don’t have a country.  Donald Trump: ( 02:55:02 ) …borders, we don’t have a country, don’t have a country. Strike down terrorists who threaten our people, and keep America out of endless and costly foreign wars. We will appoint prosecutors, judges, justices who believe in enforcing the law, not enforcing their own political agenda, which is illegal. We will ensure equal justice for citizens of every race, religion, color and creed. We will uphold your religious liberty and defend your 2nd Amendment right to keep and bear arms. And if we don’t win, your 2nd Amendment doesn’t have a chance, I can tell you that. I have totally protected it. We will protect Medicare and social security. We will always and very strongly protect patients with preexisting conditions, and that is a pledge from the entire Republican Party. Thank you, Kevin. We will end surprise medical billing, require price transparency, and further reduce the cost of prescription drugs and health insurance premiums, they’re coming way down. We will greatly expand energy development, continuing to remain the number one in the world, and keep America energy independent. And for those of you that still drive a car, look how low your gasoline bill is, you haven’t seen that in a long time. We will win the race to 5G, and build the world’s best cyber and missile defense, already under construction. We will fully restore patriotic education to our schools, and always protect, we will always, always protect free speech on college campuses. And we put a very big penalty in. They do anything having to do with your free speech, colleges have to pay a tremendous, tremendous financial penalty. And again, it’s amazing how open they’ve been lately. We will launch a new age of American ambition in space. America will land the first woman on the moon, and the United States will be the first nation to plant its beautiful flag on Mars.  Donald Trump: ( 02:58:18 ) This is the unifying national agenda that will bring our country together. So tonight I say to all Americans, this is the most important election in the history of our country. There has never been such a difference between two parties, or two individuals in ideology, philosophy, or vision, than there is right now. Our opponents believe that America is a deprived nation. We want our sons and daughters to know the truth. America is the greatest and most exceptional nation in the history of the world. Our country wasn’t built by cancel culture, speech codes and soul crushing conformity. We are not a nation of timid spirits. We are a nation of fierce, proud, and independent American Patriots. We’re a nation of pilgrims, pioneers, adventurers, explorers, and trailblazers who refused to be tied down, held back, or in any way, reigned in. Americans have steel in their spines, grit in their souls, and fire in their hearts. There is no one like us on earth.  Donald Trump: ( 02:59:51 ) I want every child in America to know that you are part of the most exciting and incredible adventure in human history. No matter where your family comes from, no matter your background in America, anyone can rise. With hard work, devotion and drive, you can reach any goal and achieve every ambition. Our American ancestors sailed across the perilous ocean to build a new life on a new continent. They braved the freezing winters, crossed the raging rivers, scaled the Rocky peaks, trekked the dangerous forests, and worked from dawn till dusk. These pioneers didn’t have money, they didn’t have fame, but they had each other. They loved their families, they loved their country, and they loved their God. When opportunity beckoned, they picked up their Bibles, packed up their belongings, climbed into their covered wagons, and set out West for the next adventure.  Donald Trump: ( 03:01:10 ) Ranchers and miners, Cowboys and sheriffs, farmers and settlers, they pressed on past the Mississippi to stake a claim in the wild frontier. Legends were born. Wyatt Earp, Annie Oakley, Davy Crockett, and Buffalo Bill. Americans built their beautiful homesteads on the open range. Soon they had churches and communities, then towns. And with time, great centers of industry and commerce. That is who they were. Americans build their future, we don’t tear down our past. We are the nation that won a revolution, toppled tyranny and fascism, and delivered millions into freedom. We laid down the railroads, built the great ships, raised up the sky scrapers, revolutionized industry, and sparked a new age of scientific discovery. We set the trends in art and music, radio and film, sport and literature. And we did it all with style and confidence and flair, because that is who we are. Whenever our way of life was threatened, our heroes answered the call from Yorktown to Gettysburg, from Normandy to Iwo Jima. American Patriots raised into cannon blasts, bullets and bayonets to rescue American liberty.  Donald Trump: ( 03:03:02 ) They had no fear, but America didn’t stop there. We looked into the sky and kept pressing onward. We built a 6 million pound rocket and launched it thousands of miles into space. We did it so that two brave patriots could stay until and salute our wondrous American flag planted on the face of the moon. For America, nothing is impossible. Over the next four years, we will prove worthy of this magnificent legacy. We will reach stunning new heights, and we will show that the world, for America, there is a dream, and it is not beyond your reach. Together we are unstoppable, together we are unbeatable, because together, we are the proud citizens of the United States of America. And on November 3rd, we will make America safer. We will make America stronger. We will make America prouder. And we will make America greater than ever before. I am very, very proud to be the nominee of the Republican Party. I love you all. God bless you and God bless America. Thank you very much.
