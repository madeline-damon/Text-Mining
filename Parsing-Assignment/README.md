## Assignment: Parsing

This repo has one notebook in it. It introduces you to parsing with `spaCy`, a
tremendously powerful NLP package that we'll start using in the latter bit of the course. 
This notebook introduces you (very briefly) to spaCy. I also recommend watching
the [introductory video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnGPv6HnBok) to learn more. 

This notebook will get you started extracting Subject-Verb-Object entities from 
a piece of text. 

### Assignment

In a notebook that you create, extract the SVOs from the Republican and Democratic 
National Conventions. Report the top 25 SVOs from each convention and write a few
sentences about what, if anything, you think we can glean from these lists.
